# Evangelism Badge

> And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. Matthew 28:18-20

In the Gospel of Matthew, these are Jesus’s final words before he was taken up into heaven. In your own life, imagine what you might say to those closest to you if you had a chance to share your final words. What would they be? They wouldn’t be about the weather, your job or the latest score of your favorite team. They would be the things closest to your heart. The same was true of Jesus here. He shared what was most important for them to hear. Making disciples was closest to his heart. Jesus’s mission and greatest longing was to spread the Gospel of the kingdom and make disciples (followers). The first step in making disciples is evangelism. In this badge, you will discuss what it means to share the Gospel in your own context and how to do it. In addition, you will have an opportunity to share your testimony with someone who doesn’t know the Lord.
