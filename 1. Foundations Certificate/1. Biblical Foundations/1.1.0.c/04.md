## GRADES

The final grade will be calculated as follows:

1. The quizzes on the lectures are each worth 30 points.
2. The final exam on the lectures is worth 100 points.
3. The Evangelism Badge Report won't affect your grade but must be submitted to complete the course.

A total course score above 80% is considered passing.

Third Millennium Ministries’ Teacher Training Course has been added as the final lesson in this eight module course. The TTC is comprised of 13 short videos that will

1. explain our view of multimedia-based education
2. give you suggestions on how to implement your own learning community
3. talk through some of the most common road blocks faced by those who look to use Thirdmill’s multimedia curriculum in their own churches

As a student of the Thirdmill Institute, we recommend you not only walk through these materials with a Trainer, but that you eventually go through them with a group of others as a Trainer. The TTC will help you to do just that!

The TTC’s table of contents with video links has been provided and we recommend your Trainer choose the video modules that are just right for your group and context as you seek to provide free Biblical education for others where God has placed you.
