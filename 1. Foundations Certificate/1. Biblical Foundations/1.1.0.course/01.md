# BIBLICAL FOUNDATIONS

Kingdom, Covenants & Canon of the Old Testament
Kingdom and Covenant in the New Testament
Teacher Training Course

## Course description

This course gives a brief survey of two major biblical themes, examining the kingdom of God and the implementation of the divine covenants, along with a single lesson on the formation of the biblical canon. We will see that the Old and New Testaments are not a random amalgam of stories, teachings and prophetic tidbits. Instead, they are unified around the central theme of the kingdom of God which was administered through covenants. This course is based on two Thirdmill video series, Kingdom, Covenants & Canon of the Old Testament, as well as Kingdom and Covenant in the New Testament produced by Third Millennium Ministries and presented by Dr. Richard L. Pratt, Jr. and Dr. Simon Vibert.
