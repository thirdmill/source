# DISTANCE

Students of the Bible often go through a similar, almost predictable process when they begin to study the Old Testament. We’re rightly taught that the Old Testament is the infallible and inspired Word of God, so many of us assume that these Scriptures must contain teachings that are easily applied to the Christian life. Now, so long as we’re highly selective and we only talk about broad topics like the attributes of God, or God’s commandments like, “You shall not steal” or “You shall not murder,” it seems like we’re in familiar territory. But something happens when we study the Old Testament more carefully. When we delve into more details, we find that many portions of the Old Testament present outlooks that are not familiar. In fact, the more we read it, the more it feels like we’re exploring an ancient, distant world.

We’ll look into the Old Testament’s distance from us in two ways. First, we’ll touch on the causes of this distance — why do these Scriptures often seem so foreign to us? And second, we’ll explore the kinds of distance we encounter. What types of outlooks in the Old Testament make it seem so very different from what we believe as modern Christians? Let’s look first at some of the main causes or reasons for the distance between ourselves and the Old Testament.

## CAUSES

At least two factors often cause us to feel distant from the Old Testament. On the one hand, God gave these Scriptures to humanity through a process known as organic inspiration. And on the other hand, God designed the Old Testament to fulfill its purpose through a process known as divine accommodation. These characteristics of the Old Testament explain many of the challenges we face as we study this part of the Bible. Consider first the process of organic inspiration.

## Organic Inspiration

It’s common to describe the historical evangelical view of the divine inspiration of Scripture as “organic inspiration.” While we affirm that the Holy Spirit inspired the Scriptures, we use this terminology to indicate that his inspiration was not divorced from the personalities, experiences and intentions of human authors. That is to say, under the special, infallible supervision of the Holy Spirit, the human authors themselves determined what to write. The Bible did not result from “mechanical” inspiration, as if God used human writers as passive conduits. Nor was the Bible romantically inspired, as if God merely encouraged biblical authors to write, much like we speak of musicians or artists “finding” inspiration. Instead, God meticulously controlled the content of Scripture so that it is without error and may rightly be called the Word of God. But he also employed the individual personalities, experiences and purposes of the human writers so that we may also rightly speak of the Scriptures as the words of holy men.

### Types of Inspiration

Mechanical
(God dictates)

Romantic
(God suggests)

Organic
(God employs)

Consider the way Peter spoke of Paul’s letters in 2 Peter 3:15-16. There we read these words:

> Count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures (2 Peter 3:15-16).

In these verses, the apostle Peter confirmed that Paul’s letters were written with the wisdom given to Paul by God. In other words, God’s Spirit inspired Paul’s letters so that they were not mere human writings, but writings from God. Yet, Peter also affirmed that Paul’s personality came through these epistles. Notice how he put it: “Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him.” These Scriptures were still Paul’s letters. We can see, then, that from Peter’s point of view, the apostle Paul’s letters resulted from a process involving both God and his human writer.

This same outlook is true of the Old Testament as well. This is why Old Testament law is not only called the law of God, but also the Law of Moses. It came from God and Moses. This is why many Psalms are called Psalms of David. The organic view of inspiration also explains why biblical authors spoke of human authors like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Daniel. Although God was the ultimate author of the Old Testament, he employed holy prophets to write these books in ways that reflected who they were, and where and when they lived.

When you think about it, it isn’t hard to see why the Bible’s organic inspiration distances us from the Old Testament. All the authors of the Old Testament were ancient people. They lived in the world of the ancient Near East and, in many respects, they thought and wrote like the people in those days. And more than this, Old Testament authors wrote before the coming of Christ. They didn’t have a fully-developed New Testament Christian theology like we do. As a result, when you and I study the Old Testament, we soon begin to see that the world of the Old Testament was very different from our modern world.

> The Old Testament Jews were living by the 600-plus Levitical laws which governed every aspect, moral, civil, spiritual, of their lives, which governed the relationships of men and women, animals, farming, feast… So, all those issues are crucial to our interpretation and understanding and not, again, trying to place a 21st century world into the first century or into the B.C. world. — Dr. Thaddeus J. James, Jr.

In addition to the challenges created by the organic inspiration of biblical authors, we should recognize that another cause of our sense of distance from the Old Testament is divine accommodation.

## Divine Accommodation

Broadly speaking, “accommodation” is a term that theologians use to describe the fact that every time God reveals himself to humanity, he speaks to us in finite human terms. Because God is transcendent and incomprehensible, whenever he reveals himself, he condescends to us in ways that finite human beings can understand. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to understand him at all. You’ll recall that in Isaiah 55:8-9 we read these words:

> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts (Isaiah 55:8-9).

God’s thoughts and ways are so transcendent — they so infinitely exceed our limitations — that every revelation he has ever made has been accommodated to human capacities. He did this so that at least some of us could understand and follow what he revealed.

Now, it’s important to realize that in the Old Testament God didn’t accommodate himself simply to the limits of humanity in a broad, general sense. Rather, he also accommodated himself to the specific historical situations of Israel living in the ancient Near East. He designed Old Testament Scriptures to be understood, in the first place, by ancient Israelites.

Because the primary audience of the Old Testament was ancient Jews, God had the Old Testament written in Hebrew and Aramaic. God gave the Ten Commandments on stones because it was an international custom for important national documents, including royal laws, to be displayed in this way. And, in many respects the literary styles of Old Testament narrative, poetry, wisdom literature, and law followed many literary conventions that were common in the ancient Near East. In these and many other ways, God accommodated the Old Testament to his ancient people so that they could understand it.

For this reason, as you and I study the Old Testament as modern people, we constantly encounter the fact that it was accommodated to people who lived long ago. It was specifically written in the first place to address the ancient people of Israel.

We often sense great distance between ourselves and the Old Testament and need something to bridge the gap.

> Every book in the Bible was written to an original audience, and we here in the 21 st century are not the original audience. I think it’s interesting and maybe helpful to us to realize that the majority of the individual books in the New Testament are epistles or letters, so when we read those epistles — and I think you could expand that to the whole Bible … we’re reading other people’s mail. They are for us because we belong to the church, but they were first written to an original audience. — Dr. Robert MacEwan

Now that we’ve seen some of the causes of the Old Testament’s distance from us, we should turn to our second subject: the kinds or types of distance we often find between ourselves and the Old Testament. What kinds of things do we encounter in the Old Testament that seem foreign to us?
