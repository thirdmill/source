Let’s think again about the contrasts that Jesus drew. With respect to the issue of murder, many people believe that Jesus expanded the prohibition against murder to include hatred. But it’s important to realize that the Old Testament not only condemned murder; it also condemned discord among God’s people.

The Old Testament opposes murder and discord.

The ideal of harmony and peace among God’s people is expressed well in Psalm 133:1 that says:

> How good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity! (Psalm 133:1).

Popular traditions in Jesus’ day excused hatred and discord among the Jews so long as they didn’t lead to physical murder. By contrast, Jesus reasserted the actual Old Testament standards by associating the prohibition against murder with the prohibition against hatred.

Regarding adultery, many people mistakenly believe that Jesus went beyond the Old Testament prohibition against physical adultery to include adultery of the heart. But in Exodus 20:17, the tenth commandment states:

> You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s (Exodus 20:17).

The Old Testament opposes adultery and coveting.

Here, the Old Testament explicitly prohibited coveting someone’s spouse — in other words, adultery of the heart. Jesus’ argument was not a denial of Old Testament law, but a reassertion of it.

With respect to divorce, in Jesus’ day many religious leaders in Israel believed that a man could divorce his wife for practically any cause. They taught that Old Testament legislation gave them this right, so long as they issued proper legal papers. But the Old Testament indicates clearly that God did not approve of such behavior. As we read in Malachi 2:16:

> “I hate divorce,” says the Lord, the God of Israel (Malachi 2:16; NASB).

In Matthew 19:3-9 Jesus explained his position on divorce in more detail. There he made it clear that his opposition to divorce was based on the Old Testament itself, particularly on the creation narrative involving Adam and Eve.

The Old Testament opposes divorce.

Regarding the practice of taking oaths, some rabbis in Jesus’ day taught that lying was permitted so long as one did not swear to keep his word. Jesus disagreed with this teaching and insisted that the Old Testament prohibited all lying, not just lies that violate oaths. For instance, Proverbs 6:16-17 begins:

> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue … (Proverbs 6:16-17).

This is why Jesus went on to say in Matthew 5:37:

> Let what you say be simply “Yes” or “No” (Matthew 5:37)

The Old Testament opposes lying.

Jesus didn’t disagree with the Old Testament, but showed that the oral traditions of the scribes and Pharisees fell short of Old Testament standards.
