Concerning revenge, the original Old Testament legislation about “eye for eye,” in Exodus 21:24, had been taken in Jesus’ day as God’s approval of personal revenge. It was believed that every time anyone did anything wrong to you, you had a right to do something equally harmful to them. But originally, “eye for eye” was part of Moses’ legislation for judges. It was designed to guide judges in the official courts of Israel. As in our own day, judges were to render their verdicts and punishments fairly and proportionally to the crimes committed.

The Old Testament opposes revenge.

Moses didn’t intend for this standard to apply to interpersonal affairs. Instead, the Old Testament taught that kindness and mercy were to guide behavior for ordinary, daily life. As Leviticus 19:18 says:

> You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people … I am the Lord (Leviticus 19:18).

Jesus disagreed with the false interpretation of a law that was intended for judges to follow in their courts, and he affirmed the Old Testament teaching that we are to show kindness in interpersonal relationships.

Finally, regarding love for enemies, some teachers in Jesus’ day taught that it was acceptable to hate their enemies. They apparently inferred from the commandment of Leviticus 19:18 — “love your neighbor as yourself” — that it was equally appropriate to hate your enemies. But the Old Testament encourages us to love our enemies. For instance, in Exodus 23:4 we read:

> If you meet your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall bring it back to him (Exodus 23:4).

The Old Testament encourages kindness to enemies.

So, as we’ve just seen, Jesus didn’t contrast his own views with those of the Old Testament. Instead, he opposed the false interpretations of his day and reasserted the true teachings of the Old Testament.

> When Jesus presents these “You have heard that it was said, but now I tell you” statements in the Sermon on the Mount, I think that the best way to look at this is that Jesus is getting at the true meaning of the Law. Not that he’s introducing something new, but that he is expositing, in a sense, what God was aiming at all along. So that when the Law says, “You shall not commit adultery,” God never intended his people to think that they could get away with looking lustfully at women who are not their wives, or even looking lustfully at their own wives. So, Jesus is not introducing a new requirement, he’s making plain what’s already inherent in the Law. — Dr. James M. Hamilton

Jesus opposed false interpretations, not the Old Testament itself.

Now that we’ve looked at a few of Jesus’ teachings that many wrongly regard as Jesus’ negative comments about the Old Testament, we should turn to several passages in which Jesus made positive affirmations of the Old Testament’s authority and relevance for everyone who follows him.
