## TEACHINGS OF PAUL

By and large, evangelical Christians depend heavily on the letters of Paul in the New Testament. But we tend to misunderstand Paul’s attitude toward the relevance of the Old Testament for Christian living. Time and again, well-meaning Christians have argued that Paul set Christ’s followers free from the authority of the Old Testament. But, as many interpreters have pointed out, there was perfect harmony between Paul and Jesus in these matters. Like Jesus, Paul opposed the ways many in his day mishandled Old Testament Scriptures, but he insisted on their unquestionable authority and relevance for Christian living.

We’ll explore the teachings of Paul in the same way that we investigated Jesus’ outlooks on these matters. First, we’ll look at a passage where Paul appears to have made negative comments about the Old Testament. Second, we’ll consider some of his positive affirmations of the relevance of the Old Testament for Christ’s followers. Consider first how Paul appears to have made negative comments about the Old Testament.

## Negative Comments

Listen to these well-known words from Galatians 3:1-5.

> O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain — if indeed it was in vain? Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith? (Galatians 3:1-5).

Notice that in this passage the apostle contrasted “works of the law” and “faith.” Many have assumed this contrast set the moral teachings of the Old Testament against the moral instructions of the New Testament or Christian way of life.

These and similar statements in Paul’s writings have led many to think that Paul rejected the relevance of the Old Testament in favor of radically different teachings of the Christian faith. In fact, many Christians argue that treating the Old Testament as if it offers authoritative guidance is to turn from the gospel. Yet, we have to look more carefully at the whole letter of Galatians, as well as other portions of Paul’s epistles. There, we find that, just like Jesus, Paul was not opposed to the Old Testament itself. He was opposed to its abuse. Paul stood firmly against the misuse of the Old Testament as a guide for meritorious, legalistic religion. Listen to the way Paul addressed the churches of Galatia later in Galatians 3:10-13:

> All who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.” Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.” But the law is not of faith, rather “The one who does them shall live by them.” Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us — for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree” (Galatians 3:10-13).

Like Christ, Paul opposed false interpretations, not the Old Testament itself.

As this passage indicates, Paul opposed the false teachers who relied on obedience to the law for their justification. When this is our orientation, we’re cursed because we’ll never obey God’s law perfectly. The only way to escape the curse of the law is through faith in Christ who took the curse of God upon himself.

Paul never opposed the Old Testament itself. He never considered the teaching of the Old Testament to be irrelevant for Christians. Rather, he opposed the false teachers who claimed that salvation depended on obedience to the law instead of faith in Christ. In fact, in his letter to the Galatians, Paul actually appealed to the Old Testament to prove his New Testament principle that justification before God is by faith alone. Listen again to Paul’s words in Galatians 3:11 where he quoted Habakkuk 2:4:

> The righteous shall live by faith (Galatians 3:11).

In much the same way, Paul illustrated this Old Testament principle using the life of Abraham in Romans 4:1-12. From his point of view, the New Testament teaching of justification by faith alone was actually rooted in the teaching of the Old Testament.

> Paul … was an apostle to the Gentiles but also loved his own countrymen, his own Jewish people. He wanted them to see, he wanted them to come to a living relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, was at pains in trying to show them that actually their heritage, which is the Old Testament, teaches that actually people are saved by faith alone, and he found key patriarchs of the faith such as Abraham, for example, that even our great father Abraham was saved by faith. That was one of the important things for Paul, to convince his own countrymen that the message he was teaching is actually rooted in the Old Testament and that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. So, it was important for him to actually use the Old Testament to illustrate that message of salvation by faith alone. — Dr. Vuyani Sindo

Paul loved the Old Testament, including the Law of Moses. In Romans 7:12 he wrote that the law is “holy and righteous and good.” But when we misuse God’s law as a way of earning salvation, we twist it into something it was never intended to be. Throughout the Old Testament, people were saved from God’s judgment by God’s grace through faith in God’s promise of the Messiah to come in the future. Obedience to God’s law was to be their response of gratitude for the grace by which they were saved. Even today we need to acknowledge this distinction. Old Testament moral instructions are relevant for Christians, not as a way of earning salvation, but as the way to show our gratitude for the salvation we have freely received in Christ.

Having seen that the negative comments about the Old Testament in Paul’s teachings were actually about the misuse of the Old Testament as a system of works- righteousness, now we should look at the apostle’s strong, positive affirmations of the Old Testament’s authority and relevance for followers of Christ.
