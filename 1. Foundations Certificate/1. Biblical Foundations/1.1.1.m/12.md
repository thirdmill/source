## Our World

As Paul put it in 1 Corinthians 10:11, the Old Testament was “written down for our instruction.” This fact requires us to recognize the responsibilities we have as followers of Christ in the modern world.

If we’re going to apply the Old Testament effectively today, we must always ask ourselves questions like these: How does the original meaning of an Old Testament passage apply to our world? How does it address the kinds of people we are and the situations we face? What are our weaknesses and strengths? These kinds of questions are crucial to the process of applying the Old Testament today.

With the challenges of application in mind, we should turn to a second closely- related issue. What are the connections that make it possible for us to take the ancient, original meaning of an Old Testament passage and apply it to our contemporary world?

## CONNECTIONS

In many ways, modern application of the Old Testament is like picking up an artifact from the ancient world, and carrying it over thousands of years and then unpacking its relevance for our world today. When you think about it, it’s quite a journey. What makes us think that this is possible? How can we succeed? Well, for any ancient book to impact a modern person, there needs to be some measure of connection between the content of that book and its reader. If there were absolutely no connections, we wouldn’t understand it at all, and we’d simply discard it. And this is true when we deal with the Old Testament as well. We must always be mindful of the connections or the commonalities that span the distance between Old Testament times and our day.

There are many ways to catalogue these connections, but it’s helpful to highlight three commonalities. We have the same God as the ancient Israelites who first received these Scriptures; we live in the same world as they did; and we’re the same kind of people. Let’s unpack these lines of connection, starting with the fact that the God of New Testament Christians is the same God we encounter in the Old Testament.

## Same God

As we’ve seen, there’s a large gap between our modern world and that of the Old Testament. But, in a very real way, there are essential truths that have stayed the same — who we are, the world we live in, and the God we serve. Faithful Christians today worship and serve the same God that faithful ancient Israelites served in the Old Testament. This fact establishes very important connections because the Scriptures teach that God is immutable or unchangeable. He is the same God today as he was in ancient times. Now, we have to be careful here. Immutability doesn’t mean that God is immobile. It doesn’t mean that he is disengaged from history.

The fact that God is the same God bridges the gap between us and the Old Testament.

## Eternal Counsel.

Traditional Christian theologians have rightly taught that there are three main ways in which God is the same immutable God. He does not change in his eternal counsel, in his divine attributes, and in his covenant promises. Let’s look at each of these ways and how they ensure that God is the same now as he was in the days of the Old Testament. First, God’s eternal counsel — his eternal plan for the universe — is unchanging.

> Whenever something happens in the world, people wonder, is this something that God really had in mind or not? And particularly when things go wrong in the world we wonder, where is God in this, and what is his purpose? And I think it’s helpful for us to understand the fullness of the biblical doctrine of the sovereignty of God because it’s clear that there’s nothing that happens that is outside the ultimate will and purpose of God. And there are lots of places we could point to in Scripture. Ephesians 1 is certainly one of those places, which, it says that God works out everything according to the purpose of his will. And so, everything that’s ever happened in history is ultimately part of the purposes of God… And God has — and this is a great mystery for us with our limited minds — God has a purpose that he’s working out through human history. — Dr. Philip Ryken

As the prophet Isaiah put it in Isaiah 46:10:

> [God is] declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, “My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose” (Isaiah 46:10).

As this passage shows, the Bible teaches that everything God has done and everything that God is doing is part of an unchanging, comprehensive design, established before his work of creation.

In these lessons, we’ll explore the goal and direction of this eternal plan in some detail, especially God’s plan to bring his kingdom to earth as it is in heaven. But at this point, it will suffice to say that the immutability of God’s eternal plan teaches us that his Old Testament purposes align with his New Testament purposes. No matter what differences we see, the two testaments do not represent two different plans. Neither plan replaces or contradicts the other. On the contrary, the Old Testament and New Testament are phases or steps of one unified plan that has and always will move history toward one unchanging goal — the goal of turning the earth into the kingdom of God.
