## Same World

As we noted earlier, it’s easy for us to focus on the differences between our day and the Old Testament. But, although much has changed since the time of ancient Israel, we still live in the same world. We must never allow ourselves to think that the Old Testament was written for another universe, a world that was fundamentally different from our own. The world of the Old Testament was the same world in which you and I live today. We share a common history and a common set of circumstances with Old Testament believers.

The fact that we live in the same world bridges the gap between us and the Old Testament.

### Historical Backgrounds.

The fact that Old Testament believers lived in the same world as we do, establishes at least two kinds of connections between our New Testament faith and the faith of the Old Testament. First, the Old Testament provides historical backgrounds that explain many of our current experiences. And second, the Old Testament describes parallel situations that mirror many of our current experiences. Let’s explore what we mean when we say that the Old Testament provides historical backgrounds to our experiences of faith.

One of the most obvious, yet remarkable features of the Old Testament is that it provides backgrounds to events and teachings in the New Testament and in our world today. Old Testament events didn’t take place in a vacuum. They weren’t fictitious. They happened in real history, and many of them left marks on the world that will endure for all time.

For example, the Ten Commandments given to Israel at Mount Sinai established an enduring background for the moral teaching of the New Testament. And we can even see the impact of the Ten Commandments in monuments and ethical teachings around the world today. In a similar way, God’s choice of David as the head of a permanent dynasty for God’s people provided the historical explanation for Jesus’ ancestry as the great son of David. And of course, as the son of David, Jesus still remains the King over all, the only one who can give us salvation. In these and countless other ways, the Old Testament provides historical backgrounds for our day. 

### Parallel Situations.

In the second place, we know that we share the same world as Old Testament believers because, not only do we recognize historical backgrounds to our experiences, but we also see many parallel situations between the Old Testament and our day.

Like Old Testament believers, we live in a world created by God but fallen into sin. The faithful in the Old Testament faced opposition from other people and from demonic powers, and we face the same opposition today. In the Old Testament, the people depended on God’s help to overcome. We depend on his help as well. These kinds of parallels are extensive. Once we look beyond the superficial dissimilarities, we can see that we live in circumstances that are very similar to those of Old Testament writers and their audiences.

One of the most compelling features of Scripture is how it points out the parallels between one set of earlier events and later events. The prophets aligned Israel’s exodus from Egypt with Israel’s return from exile. The Gospels aligned the life of Jesus with Israel’s exodus from Egypt. The apostle Paul pointed to the parallels between Israel marching toward the Promised Land and the lives of Christians following Christ toward the new heavens and earth. Jesus noted the parallels between Moses lifting up the serpent in the wilderness and how he himself would be lifted up on the cross. The list goes on and on. Theologians often call these parallels “biblical typology.” Biblical typologies are based on the fact that later circumstances parallel earlier circumstances. And these parallels exist in large part because we still live in the same world as God’s people in the Old Testament.

In addition to having the same God and the same world, we may also find connections between the Old Testament and our day because we’re dealing with the same kind of people.
