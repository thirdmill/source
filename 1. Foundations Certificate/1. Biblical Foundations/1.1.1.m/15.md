## Same People

There are many differences between the ancient peoples of the Old Testament and modern human beings. But Scripture teaches that we are all the same kind of people. We’re connected by crucial continuities that underlie our differences and unite us, even across time and culture.

The fact that we are the same kind of people bridges the gap between us and the Old Testament.

### Image of God.

There are at least three ways in which we’re the same kind of people as the people in the Old Testament. All human beings are the image of God; we’re all sinful; and all people are in covenant with God. First, all human beings, no matter when or where they live, are the image of God. This is a clear teaching throughout the Old and New Testaments. In Genesis 1:27 we read these words:

> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them (Genesis 1:27).

In Genesis 9:6 we find that even after sin corrupted humanity, human beings are still the image of God. There we read:

> Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image (Genesis 9:6).

And beyond this, the New Testament also affirms that all people are the image or likeness of God. James 3:9 says this:

> With [the tongue] we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God (James 3:9).

And as Paul put it in 1 Corinthians 11:7:

> Man … is the image and glory of God (1 Corinthians 11:7).

> In God creating man and woman in his image, we see that that is something that we share in common with … all of those who existed in the Old Testament, Adam and Eve of course being the first man and woman. And so that hasn’t gone away, and that’s a fundamental … similarity that we have in common with all the saints that have gone before us and all the people that have gone before us. — Rev. Timothy Mountfort

Understanding our role as God’s image is crucial to understanding God’s kingdom purposes throughout history. We’ll have much more to say about what it means to be the image of God in a later lesson. But, at this point, it will suffice to say that a number of shared traits characterize human beings. In the past, the church has focused attention especially on the fact that human beings are rational, that we have special linguistic abilities, and that we are moral or religious creatures.

The fact that both the Old and New Testaments affirm that all people are the image of God warns us not to overestimate the differences between people of the Old Testament times and modern people. Of course, we’re all different in many ways, but beneath the surface, we who live today are not entirely different from ancient people. Although we’re not exactly like them, we can assume that the rational, linguistic and moral qualities that characterized their lives also characterize ours. They thought much like we think. They understood language much like we understand it. They wrestled with questions of morality and faith much like we do. And for these reasons, we can have confidence that we can apply the Old Testament to our lives. The people who first wrote it and first received it were the image of God, just like we are.

### Sinful.

In the second place, we’re also the same kind of people as those of the Old Testament because all human beings are sinful. Consider the words of Romans 3:12 where Paul drew from the Psalms as he described the sinful condition of people. He wrote:

> All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one (Romans 3:12).

The apostle made it clear that all people have sinned. And this is not just a New Testament teaching. In 1 Kings 8:46, Solomon expressed essentially the same thing at the dedication of the temple when he said:

> There is no one who does not sin (1 Kings 8:46).

> In systematic theology, there is this teaching known as “total depravity.” And what that means is that in the totality of man’s being, in his thinking, feeling and behavior, it’s all been tainted with sin so that there is that basic assumption that everything he does, he does it in defiance of God’s commandments and holy standards. So yes, there is such a thing as a sinful nature. — Dr. Luis Orteza

Because we are sinful, fallen images of God, it’s not difficult for us to grasp why the Old Testament writers focused so much on sin. We connect with the Old Testament on this level because we know that we’re sinners — just like the Old Testament’s original recipients were and everyone since has been. We also understand why the Old Testament focuses on the redemption of sinners. From the time of humanity’s fall into sin, all people have been in need of redemption. This fact also connects us to the ancient world of the Old Testament.
