# DEVELOPMENTS

As we saw earlier, the application of the Old Testament to our lives today must account for the many historical developments that took place in biblical faith, both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. The Old Testament, the New Testament and our Christian faith today represent one religion, one faith. Yet, we must always acknowledge that various kinds of developments took place.

There are many ways to describe these developments, but we’ll highlight three major types: epochal developments, cultural developments and personal developments. In the first place, God has revealed himself and his will to his people in epochs or ages.

## Epochal

Biblical history is a lengthy account of the way God disclosed himself to his people progressively as history moved toward its divinely-ordained end in Christ. There are many different ways to explore this history, but one helpful way is to divide it into major periods or epochs that correspond to God’s covenants with his people. In each of these covenant periods, God revealed more of himself. Put simply, God revealed more to Noah than he did to Adam. He revealed more to Abraham than he did to Noah. Moses received more revelation than Abraham did. And God granted David more revelation than Moses. And in the New Testament age, God has revealed more than ever before.

God disclosed himself to his people progressively.

The writer of Hebrews stressed this point in Hebrews 1:1-2 when he wrote:

> Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son (Hebrews 1:1-2).

Like biblical authors themselves, Christians have divided biblical history into different periods or epochs in different ways. But by and large, Christians have acknowledged that the greatest epochal development in biblical history took place between the Old Testament and the New Testament. This epochal division is crucial to the application of God’s Word today. And for millennia, Christians have asked this question, “How do the teachings of the Old Testament apply in the New Testament age?

Faithful Christians rightly believe that the Old Testament applies to us, but they have different ways of applying its message to our age. On one end of the spectrum are those who promote a segmented view of biblical history. These Christians especially emphasize the differences between the Old and New Testament eras. They assume that we should only apply to modern believers those Old Testament teachings that are explicitly reaffirmed in the New Testament. Otherwise, the Old Testament doesn’t apply to followers of Christ.

On the other end of the spectrum are several extreme positions that promote a flattened view of biblical faith. These Christians stress the continuity of Old and New Testament periods. In this view, as long as the New Testament doesn’t explicitly reject or modify an Old Testament teaching, Christians are obligated to follow it like those who lived before Christ.

In this lesson, we’ll avoid both of these extremes by emphasizing what we may call a “developmental view” of biblical faith. In this view, all of the Old Testament is to be applied to New Testament Christians. But we must also acknowledge that every dimension of the Old Testament has developed because of what God has done in Christ. All Old Testament teachings apply to Christians, but always in the light of the New Testament.

> The relationship between the Old Testament and the New Testament is a question of a lot of debates. And it really is even today a question of a lot of discussion. And one way that we like to approach this development of what we call “progressive revelation” — so God didn’t reveal everything at the beginning — the history of the development of the theology, of the teaching of the Old Testament in relationship to the New Testament, is really a question of partial revelation at the beginning and then a fuller revelation in the New Testament with the teaching of Jesus and the apostles in writing down the reality of the theology of the church. — Dr. Daniel Steffen

In Galatians 3:24 Paul spoke of the relationship between Old Testament and New Testament faith in this way:

The law was our guardian until Christ came (Galatians 3:24).

In this verse, the word “guardian” translates the Greek noun paidagogos (παιδαγωγός). This term referred to a tutor or caretaker who would instruct, guide and discipline a child as he or she grew to maturity. So, as Paul indicated here, Old Testament teachings were like the instructions given to a child, but New Testament teachings are like the instructions given to an adult heir.

We all know that parents teach young children lessons like “Don’t go in the street.” “Stay away from the fire.” But when children become adults, we don’t warn them to stay out of the street or to stay away from fire anymore. After all, they’re adults. Still, parents expect their adult children to remember the wisdom of their childhood rules. We expect adults to remember that roads and fire are dangerous and to approach them with care. For us to treat an adult like a young child is foolishness. But it’s just as foolish for adults to forget what they learned from their childhood lessons.

In many ways, the Old Testament resembles rules given to a child. It was designed for the spiritual condition of the people of Old Testament Israel as they grew to maturity. The New Testament is instruction for those who live after the revelation of God in Christ. If we, as New Testament believers, obey the Old Testament as people in Old Testament times did, we deny the significance of Christ. But if we reject the wisdom taught in the Old Testament, we deny Christ’s own regard for the authority of the Old Testament. As faithful followers of Christ, we are to submit to the authority of the Old Testament, but we are to do so as those upon whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.

In addition to epochal developments, if we’re to apply the Old Testament in our day, we must also consider cultural developments.
