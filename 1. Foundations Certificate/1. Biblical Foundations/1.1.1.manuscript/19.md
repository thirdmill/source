# CONCLUSION

In this lesson, we’ve asked why we should study the Old Testament. We’ve acknowledged the difficulties we face because of the distance between us and this ancient book, including the causes of that distance and the kinds of distance we encounter. We’ve also seen that the New Testament strongly affirms the Old Testament’s relevance for our day, especially through the teachings of Jesus and Paul. And we’ve outlined the paths we must follow by considering the challenges, connections and developments associated with application of the Old Testament to our lives.

All too often, followers of Christ are satisfied to know very little about the Old Testament and only to look to the New Testament as God’s Word for them. But as important as the New Testament is, it will never suffice for Christians who hope to grow in their faith. We need the Old Testament as well. It takes a lot of work to study the Old Testament, but it’s worth every effort. The Old Testament is the Word of God. And as faithful disciples of Christ, we should devote ourselves to these Scriptures as Christ devoted himself to them. When we do, we’ll find that the Old Testament is a wondrous gift that God has given for us to follow in every place and in every age.
