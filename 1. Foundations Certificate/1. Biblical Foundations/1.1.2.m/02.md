# DEVELOPING

When the Scriptures speak of God’s kingdom as something that develops, they focus on how God displays or manifests his unwavering sovereignty with the passage of time. Now, most modern Christians have never lived in a kingdom where human kings have supreme unbridled authority over their nations. So, we often fail to see how prominent this theme is in the Bible. To refer to God revealing his kingship in history, Old Testament authors frequently used common depictions of divine and human kings that we don’t recognize today. For example, they spoke of God as a royal architect and builder, the royal father of his people, the lawgiver and the covenant-maker. They described God as a royal warrior, a husband and a shepherd.

Modern people often think of kings and kingdoms as very impersonal, even abhorrent political systems. But the biblical theme of God’s historical kingdom coming to earth is rich, even splendid imagery. It reveals the wonder of God as the unrivaled sovereign over all of creation and his kingdom on earth as our glorious ideal.

Throughout the Old and New Testaments, God issued royal decrees from his heavenly throne. He loved the people of his kingdom as a father loves his children. He called his angelic and human armies into action. He acted as king when he established and defeated nations, including his favored nation, Israel. The grand goal of these historical manifestations of God’s reign was for every creature everywhere to acknowledge that God is king. Ultimately, the entire creation will be a place of love, joy, goodness, justice, healing and peace for God’s people from every tribe and nation. And God will fill the earth with his visible glory and receive endless praise for who he is and what he has done.

A simple way to introduce this Old Testament theme is to turn to the opening words of “The Lord’s Prayer.” In Matthew 6:9-10, Jesus summarized Old Testament outlooks on God’s developing kingdom when he taught his disciples to pray this way:

> Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:9-10).

When Jesus taught us to pray, “Your kingdom come,” he expressed what every Old Testament author longed to see. It’s quite common for Christians to speak of the coming of the kingdom, but all too often we don’t realize how this Christian belief is rooted in the Old Testament. So, we should take a moment to consider what Jesus meant when he taught us to pray for the coming of the kingdom.

When Jesus teaches his disciples how to pray, drawing off of the whole anthology of the Psalter, he distills it down to this very basic outline of a faithful prayer. But the prayer starts with this: “Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.” Now notice that, even for Jesus, God’s fatherhood is tied directly to his royalty. God is not merely a father, he’s a king-father. And so, as a faithful son, when you come before your father, you want his kingdom expanded. You want to see his reign brought to bear in every aspect of the human life. — Dr. Scott Redd

Following the custom of ancient Hebrew poetry, Jesus explained what he meant when he taught us to pray for God’s kingdom to come. In the first place, Jesus spoke of God as the “Father in heaven,” a reference to God as the royal Father, the King, enthroned in heaven. And he taught us to pray for God’s name to be kept holy — “hallowed be your name.” Elaborating on this petition, he acknowledged that God’s name will be kept holy when his kingdom comes. And then, to explain what he meant by the coming of God’s kingdom, Jesus added that the kingdom or rule of God will come in its fullness when his will is done. But notice where Jesus wanted God’s will to be done: “on earth as it is in heaven.” Unlike many Christians believe today, Jesus did not teach that the goal of history is for God’s people to spend eternity with God in heaven. Rather, Jesus taught that the goal of history is for God’s will to be done on the earth as it is already done in the throne room of heaven.

Jesus taught us to pray that God would bring his kingdom to earth.

> Our sure hope is that there is a day coming when God will renew all things… We can see this especially in the beautiful words that Jesus taught us, his disciples, to pray when he said, “Our Father who is in heaven, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come, and let your will be done on this earth, even as it now is in heaven.” That crucial, central, foundational Christian idea is that we are now living in a time of waiting for the heavenly realities to become earthly realities, that the way things are done in heaven when God is hallowed, when all things are right, and righteousness and glory and truth and love reigns; our hope as Christians, our sure hope, is that those realities of heaven will become earthly realities. And this is what the Scriptures promise in hope as the new creation, our eternal home. — Dr. Jonathan T. Pennington

To understand better how Jesus hoped the earth would become like heaven, consider Daniel 7:9-10. Here we find a typical Old Testament portrait of God’s heavenly throne room:

> Thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire. A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him (Daniel 7:9-10).

This portrait of heaven is not unusual. Similar descriptions of God’s heavenly throne room appear in the Old and New Testaments. But there are at least two dimensions of Daniel’s vision that we should highlight.

On the one hand, God displays his visible, glorious presence before the creatures in his heavenly throne room. As the Scriptures teach, God is omnipresent — he is everywhere. He is present in all the vast galaxies of outer space, on our tiny planet, in lush forests and dry deserts, in every small village and every massive city. Yet, in his omnipresence, he largely remains invisible. Even so, as Daniel’s vision and many other Scriptures tell us, God’s presence is visible to every creature in the throne room of heaven. God sits on his throne, wearing radiant white garments, with hair white as wool. His throne is ablaze with fire, and consuming fire flows from his throne.

This portrait of heaven is one dimension of the contrast Jesus’ prayer acknowledged between heaven and earth. Yes, we see God’s glory reflected in the wonders of creation. And in biblical history, the glory of God was sometimes visible on earth. But these glimpses of God’s glory hardly compare with the overwhelming splendor of God in his heavenly throne room. So, when Jesus called for us to pray for God’s kingdom to come to earth as it is in heaven, he called for us to pray for the overwhelming brilliance of God’s visible glory to fill the earth as it already fills heaven. This is what the apostle John had in mind in Revelation 21:23 when he described the glory of the New Jerusalem that will descend to earth when Christ returns. Listen to John’s words:

> The city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb (Revelation 21:23).

When Jesus taught us to pray for the kingdom of God to come to earth as it is in heaven, he meant that we should yearn and pray for God to fill the earth with his glorious, royal splendor.

On the other hand, Daniel’s vision of heaven also associates God’s brilliant, glorious presence with the activities of the creatures who are there. As we read in Daniel 7:10:

> A thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him (Daniel 7:10).

Countless creatures before the throne of God in heaven attend to him, worship him, and humbly do his bidding.

> Angels in heaven actually function as the priests of heaven; they serve God day and night in his temple, and they worship him day and night. They also serve as God’s messengers and God’s helpers to us here on earth — very clear throughout Scripture. But the control is absolute; it is God’s and God’s alone. — Dr. Grant R. Osborne

> God is sovereign over everything that’s happening. He’s at least allowing it, but he doesn’t endorse or approve of many of the things that are happening. But we’re going to experience a kingdom someday when people will obey the moral will of God. They will willingly do that because they will have the law written on their hearts. — Dr. Robert B. Chisholm, Jr.

This is why, in Philippians 2:10-11, the apostle Paul looked forward to the day when:

> At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (Philippians 2:10-11).

In the opening lines of the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus summed up the Old Testament theme of the kingdom of God as a developing, historical, earthly reality. Like all of God’s faithful prophets throughout history, the Son of God longed for the day when God’s universal and unchanging kingship would be fully manifested on earth. On that day, God’s glory will fill the earth and every creature will obey his commands as perfectly on earth as they do in heaven. This vision of history undergirds every teaching of the Old and New Testaments.

Now that we’ve distinguished how the Scriptures speak of the kingdom of God in both broad and narrow senses, we’re in a position to explore how the Bible portrays the historical development of God’s kingdom on earth. We’ll start with the period of time often called the “primeval history,” that covers the events described in Genesis 1:1–11:9.
