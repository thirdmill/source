# PRIMEVAL HISTORY

When modern evangelicals read the primeval history of Genesis, we’re often preoccupied with what it says about the age of the earth, the origin of human life and other contemporary scientific issues. These topics are important, but they easily draw our attention away from how these chapters first introduced ancient Israelites to the earliest stages of how the kingdom of God developed on earth. As we’re about to see, the primeval history emphasized how God acted as king at this time — how he exerted his royal authority to create, to arrange and to populate the visible world so that it would become the place where he would extend his sovereign rule from heaven.

> The primeval history covers the history that we see from Genesis 1–11; it’s pre-Abrahamic history. So, it covers the origin of the world like what we find in Genesis 1. It also covers even the creation of mankind, how mankind came into being in this world. It covers the Sabbath as well as marriage, the institution of marriage, and God’s dealings with his people before Abraham, so how God dealt with Noah and the flood. — Dr. Daniel Simango

We’ll explore how the primeval history introduces the developing kingdom or rule of God in earth’s history by touching on three issues: first, how this part of the Bible describes the earth as the place of God’s kingdom; second, how it identifies the people for God’s kingdom purposes; and third, how it depicts the early progress of God’s kingdom during this period. Let’s look first at earth as the place of God’s kingdom.

## PLACE

The opening chapters of Genesis reveal that the earth was made to be the place of God’s royal rule in many ways, but we’ll focus on just two. First, we’ll see how God’s initial preparations of creation reflected his royal purposes for the earth. And second, we’ll see how God set the stage for the ongoing expansion of his kingdom on earth. Let’s begin by looking at God’s initial preparations in his magnificent royal design of creation.

## Initial Preparations

To grasp what the primeval history has to say about God’s initial preparations for his kingdom on earth, we have to set aside, for the moment, many of our modern questions. We first need to ask how ancient Israelites understood the story of Genesis in 1:1–2:3. It helps to know that throughout the ancient world, both divine and human kings were often honored as great architects and builders. Along these lines, a number of interpreters have shown that the creation story presents God as the true divine royal architect and builder who designed creation to be his massive royal palace. Every time the creation account refers to God saying, “Let [this or that happen],” it depicts God as directing the construction of creation through royal edicts from his heavenly throne. In a similar way, parallel accounts in other ancient literature indicate that God’s rest on the Sabbath Day portrayed God as resting on his throne to receive honor for having successfully exerted his royal authority and power over creation. In these and other ways, the opening of the book of Genesis taught ancient Israel how their God, the divine architect and builder, first extended his royal power from heaven into the visible world.

The creation story begins with these familiar words in Genesis 1:1:

> In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1:1).

These opening words establish the fact that God created two realms or levels — heaven above and the visible earth below. In Genesis 1:2–2:3 God began to construct the earth into a place for his glorious reign to extend from heaven to earth. We can divide this part of Genesis into three sections, starting with the initial chaos of the world. Listen to the way 1:2 describes the earth:

> The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters (Genesis 1:2).

As we see here, at first the earth, or the creation below heaven, was “without form and void,” covered with darkness and the deep.

At this point, the earth stood in sharp contrast with God’s glorious heavenly throne room. As we’ve just seen, throughout the Scriptures heaven is filled with the blinding glory of God, but the earth was not at this time. The Hebrew terms translated here “without form” and “void” are used elsewhere in the Old Testament to refer to wild and desert places on the earth, places that are largely uninhabitable by human beings. And the terms “darkness” and “the deep,” have very negative connotations throughout the Scriptures.

But Genesis 1:2 tells us another essential fact about the opening of earth’s history. It says, “The Spirit of God was hovering over … the waters.” The God of light and life was not satisfied to leave the earth in its initial chaotic condition. His Spirit began to move on the dark, lifeless world.

The second major section of the creation account in Genesis 1, is the six days of God’s ordering of the world into a palatial edifice in verses 3-31. These six days exhibit a discernable pattern that displays God’s unsurpassed architectural wisdom and power.

In the first three days, God dealt with the fact that the world was formless. In the second three days, he dealt with the fact that the world was void or empty. God’s actions in these two sets of days parallel each other in remarkable ways.

The six days of creation

In day one God formed the day and restricted the darkness to the night. And correspondingly, in day four he placed the sun, moon and stars in the sky to maintain this order. In day two God formed the atmosphere, separating the waters below from the waters above. Then in day five, God filled the space between the waters with birds, and filled the waters below with sea creatures. On the third day God restrained the waters below by forming lush, fertile land. And on the sixth day, God placed land animals and humanity on the dry land. God displayed incomparable royal wisdom and power as he arranged and populated the world.

The third and closing section of the creation story depicts the Sabbath day in 2:1-3. As in the previous verses, this account also highlights God as the royal architect and builder of creation.

We read in Genesis 2:3:

> So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation (Genesis 2:3).

Here, the picture is that God sat back on his throne in heaven, delighted in his accomplishments, and received honor for what he had done. His work was so magnificent that later, in the Ten Commandments, God commanded Israel to commemorate his accomplishments every Sabbath day.

In effect, Genesis 1:1–2:3 tells us that for six days God issued royal decrees from his heavenly throne that turned the world from darkness and chaos into a magnificent royal edifice. And in the end, God received honor for what he had done as the royal architect and builder of creation.

We’ve considered how God made initial preparations for the place of his kingdom purposes in the opening of Genesis. Now we should turn to a special feature of this royal design that is often overlooked. God also revealed that he had ordained the ongoing expansion of his royal rule to the ends of the earth.
