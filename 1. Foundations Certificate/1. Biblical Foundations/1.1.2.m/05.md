# PEOPLE

Have you ever noticed how much the Scriptures refer to human beings? It’s nearly impossible to find a single page of the Bible that doesn’t refer in one way or another to people. And at first, this may seem strange because we usually think of the Bible as the revelation of who God is and what he has done. And this is certainly true. But the drama of biblical history also stresses the special, crucial role that human beings play in God’s plan for creation. Of course, human beings can do nothing good apart from the benevolence of God. And for this reason, in an ultimate sense, all glory belongs to God alone. Yet, the Scriptures make it clear that God determined to fulfill his kingdom purposes primarily through the human race. This is why the Scriptures have so much to say about people. They explain why the New Testament stresses the humanity of Jesus, the only perfect, righteous human being who fulfills the purposes for which human beings were first created.

This special role for humanity becomes clear in Genesis 2:18 where God said this about Adam in the Garden of Eden:

> The Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him” (Genesis 2:18).

Earlier, in Genesis 1, God concluded that the creation was “very good.” But he also found something in his royal garden that was “not good” — Adam had no wife. But why was this not good? It was because God had created humanity for a purpose that was too great for one man to accomplish on his own. Many people were required to accomplish humanity’s role in the development of God’s kingdom on earth. This critical role for people is described in two ways. God made Adam and Eve to serve as his priests and as his vice- regents or royal representatives. These roles are interconnected in the Scriptures, but we’ll look at them separately, starting with the service of human beings as God’s priests.

God made Adam and Eve.

## Priests

On the one side, Adam — and later Eve along with him — was given the task of serving as God’s priest. He was called to honor God with acts of worship. We noted earlier that, in Daniel’s vision, countless creatures minister before the Lord in his heavenly court. And this is what Adam and Eve were called to do on earth. We can see this priestly role for humanity in Genesis 2:15 where we read these words:

> The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it (Genesis 2:15, NIV).

At first glance, we might think that this passage simply notes that God called Adam to be a gardener. But his task was much more than this because the Garden of Eden was a sacred, royal garden for God. The expression “to work it and take care of it” is unusual and had a special significance for Moses and ancient Israel. In a number of places, similar expressions in the Pentateuch are used to describe the work of priests and Levites before the glory of God in the Tabernacle. For example, in Numbers 3:8 we read:

> They are to take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle (Numbers 3:8, NIV).

The description of Adam and Eve’s role in the garden reflects this description of the Levites’ role in their priestly service to God. Adam and Eve were placed in God’s holy, royal garden, the place of the divine King’s glory on earth. There they served God much like priests and Levites served later in the Tabernacle where the glory of God appeared before Israel. Adam and Eve were called to perform all of their work as sacred priestly service — as acts designed to honor the great divine King in worship.

Like the Levites, Adam and Eve served God as priests in his holy dwelling.

On the other side, the first people who lived on earth were not only to serve as God’s priests. God also called for them to serve as his vice-regents, his royal representatives. In effect, Adam and Eve were God’s royal priests.
