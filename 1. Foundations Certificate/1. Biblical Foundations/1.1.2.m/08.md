## Corruption and Judgment

According to the book of Genesis, when Adam and Eve fell into sin, it was no longer true that all of their descendants would be faithful to God. In fact, none of them could serve as God’s faithful images apart from God’s redeeming mercy. Much of the human race continued to rebel against God. Adam and Eve’s first son, Cain, murdered his brother, Abel. And Cain’s genealogy in Genesis 4 tells us that, as Cain’s family grew, their rebellion worsened. Instead of serving as God’s royal priests, Cain’s descendants exalted themselves in resistance to God’s reign and filled the earth with violence against other human beings. And as time went on, the violence of humanity caused God to cleanse the earth with a worldwide flood.

Human wickedness was great on the earth.

As we read in Genesis 6:5-7:

> The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the Lord said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them” (Genesis 6:5-7).

The record of the progress of God’s kingdom during the primeval history not only includes humanity’s cosmic treason and their corruption and subsequent judgment. It also reveals that God established a long-term strategy that would eventually result in the spread of his kingdom throughout the world. In effect, God determined to redeem a people for himself over time and to build his kingdom through them.

## Long-Term Strategy

The first hint of this long-term strategy was introduced in Genesis 3:15. Here, God cursed the serpent who had instigated Adam and Eve’s sin with these words:

> I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel (Genesis 3:15, NIV).

In this passage, God announced to the serpent that the human race will be divided into two parties: Satan’s offspring, or “seed” as it is often translated — those human beings who align themselves with Satan’s rebellious ways — and Eve’s offspring, those human beings who seek to serve God faithfully. These two groups of people will be at enmity with each other throughout history. God also promised that one day Eve’s seed — redeemed humanity — will crush the head of the serpent, conquering the one who had led them into cosmic treason. This promise is ultimately fulfilled by Christ. Listen to the way Paul assured Christ’s followers in Romans 16:20:

> The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet (Romans 16:20).

The hope of victory over evil for redeemed, faithful images of God extends throughout history and reaches its fulfillment in Christ, the perfect image of God.

Because of God’s long-term strategy for his kingdom, a third son, Seth, was born to replace faithful Abel. As the genealogy of Genesis 5 tells us, Seth and his descendants honored God and sought to extend his kingdom throughout the earth. And even when human violence so filled the world that God destroyed most of humanity, one descendant of Seth — Noah — was faithful to God and found favor in God’s eyes. After the great flood of Noah’s day, God reaffirmed his long-term strategy for the fulfillment of humanity’s service to his kingdom.

In Genesis 8:21-22, we read these words:

> I will never again curse the ground because of man, [even though] the intention of man’s heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease (Genesis 8:21-22).

Notice how God recognized that all human beings are prone to evil, even from their youth. He acknowledged that sin would continue to wreak havoc on his fallen image. So, under the sign of the rainbow, God announced that he would stabilize the natural order of “seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night”, as long as the earth remains. But why did God establish this secure order for nature after the flood? His reason becomes clear in the words that immediately follow in Genesis 9:1:

> God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (Genesis 9:1).

As this verse tells us, God renewed his call for human beings to serve his kingdom purposes. He established the stability of nature so that the image of God could fulfill its original service to his kingdom. 

> When God created humanity — we go back to Genesis 1 — and God created us in his image, male and female in his image, and said, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.” And it’s not just before sin enters in … but even after he destroys the earth with the flood, and Noah and his wife and the sons and their wives, they all get out of the ark, and he once again says, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.” God’s given us this earth for our good and for his glory. — Dr. Rick Boyd

From this point forward, the Scriptures reveal how the path of humanity’s service to God’s kingdom was not straightforward or uninterrupted. God’s people faced strong opposition. They failed and suffered many setbacks. Yet, God established long-term stability in nature so that one day the image of God would fulfill the task of spreading his kingdom to the ends of the earth.

Now that we’ve seen what the Scriptures teach about the kingdom of God during the primeval history, we’re ready to move to the next major stage of kingdom history in the Old Testament, the period in which God dealt especially with the nation of Israel as the chosen people of his kingdom.
