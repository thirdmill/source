# NATION OF ISRAEL

It’s difficult to miss the fact that the nation of Israel plays a central role in biblical history. But why? The Scriptures focus on the people of Israel because God chose them to lead the entire human race in the service he had ordained for his images from the beginning. The Israelites were the seed of the woman, the royal priesthood, his treasured possession, his firstborn among the nations. And as such, they were to grow in number and have dominion over the earth in service to God’s kingdom. Now the Israelites repeatedly failed to be faithful to God, and God brought severe judgment against them, but God never cancelled this role for Israel. As we’re about to see, throughout the Scriptures, God remained committed to Israel leading all the nations into his service.

To see how the kingdom of God unfolded throughout the history of the nation of Israel, we’ll look again at three topics. First, we’ll explore the place or location of the kingdom. Second, we’ll look at the people of the kingdom in the nation of Israel. And third, we’ll sketch the progress of the kingdom in Israel. Let’s look first at the place of God’s kingdom.

## PLACE

When God first put Adam and Eve on earth, he planted them in a special place — in the Garden of Eden. But he also commissioned them to serve as his images by establishing his will throughout the whole world. Now as we’re about to see, when God chose Abraham and his descendants, he called for them to orient themselves toward the vicinity of Eden once again and from there to fulfill humanity’s original commission.

Listen to the way Genesis 12:1-3 describes when God first called Abraham, the father of Israel, to be his special servant. God said:

> Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed (Genesis 12:1-3).

Notice the geographical focus of this passage. God called Abraham to leave his father’s homeland in Mesopotamia and to migrate to a land Abraham had not yet seen.

God led Abraham from Ur to the Holy Land.

God led Abraham from Ur in Mesopotamia to Haran. And later, God called Abraham from Haran to the land of Canaan, the land that we often call the “Promised Land.” When Abraham arrived in Canaan, God confirmed that his descendants would take possession of that place as their enduring homeland. And from that time forward, the Promised Land became the staging ground for Israel’s kingdom service.

Abraham’s call to the Promised Land helps us understand the place of God’s kingdom in the history of Israel in at least two ways. First, God called Abraham and his descendants to serve him at the original geographical center of his kingdom. Second, God called Israel to carry out the geographical expansion of his kingdom beyond the borders of the Promised Land. Let’s look at the idea that God called Abraham and his descendants to serve him at the original center of his kingdom on earth.
