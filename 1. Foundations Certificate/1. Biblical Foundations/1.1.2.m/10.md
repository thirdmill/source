## Original Center

A few moments ago, we saw that the original centerpiece of God’s earthly kingdom
was the land of Eden and the sacred garden within it. Unfortunately, many biblical
interpreters have mistakenly assumed that Eden was somewhere in lower Mesopotamia,
near the Persian Gulf. We don’t know for certain how much territory was considered the
land of Eden. It could have extended throughout what we now call the Fertile Crescent.
But the book of Genesis itself closely associates the land and Garden of Eden with the land
that God promised to Abraham.

This geographical orientation becomes clear in Genesis 2:10-14 where God
described the boundaries of Eden:

> A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and
became four rivers. The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that
flowed around the whole land of Havilah … The name of the second river
is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush. And
the name of the third river is the Tigris … And the fourth river is the
Euphrates (Genesis 2:10-14).

Four rivers formed the boundaries of Eden.

Notice here that four primeval rivers are associated with Eden. The first two are the Pishon and the Gihon. Scholars still debate where these rivers were located. But here, they’re associated with the land of Havilah and Cush to the southwest of the Promised Land. The second two, the Tigris and the Euphrates, stream eastward from the mountainous regions of modern Syria. Understanding this much about the locations of the rivers of Eden is important because, broadly speaking, these locations correlate with rivers that were also associated later in the book of Genesis with the land God promised to Abraham. Listen to Genesis 15:18 and the way God described the land he promised to Abraham and his descendants:

> To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates (Genesis 15:18).

As we see here, rivers marked the boundaries of Israel’s Promised Land — the river of Egypt and the river Euphrates.

Most interpreters rightly agree that the “river of Egypt” was not the Nile, but was one of a number of rivers or wadis in northeastern Egypt. Beyond this, the river Euphrates, the upper Euphrates in modern western Syria, marked the northeastern boundary of the Promised Land. Later in biblical history, these rivers marked the extent of Israel’s lands during the reigns of David and Solomon.

As we can see, the Promised Land’s geographical boundaries roughly parallel the boundaries of the land of Eden. So, as other biblical passages indicate, when God called Abraham to Canaan, he called him back to the original centerpiece of earth’s geography, to Eden, where Adam and Eve first began to serve God’s kingdom.

The place of Eden not only helps us understand that God first called Abraham, and later brought Moses, to the original geographical center of God’s kingdom. It also indicates that Israel’s Promised Land was the starting point for the geographical expansion of God’s reign through Israel to the ends of the earth.
