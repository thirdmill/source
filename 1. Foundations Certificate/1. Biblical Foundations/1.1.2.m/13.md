# PROGRESS

The story of Israel in the Old Testament includes both positive accomplishments and abysmal failures. Nearly every generation of Israel rebelled against God in one way or another and suffered under God’s temporary judgments. But time and again, God brought Israel to repentance and renewed them. Still, toward the end of the Old Testament, Israel’s sins became so great that God brought a great curse of exile from the Promised Land. For hundreds of years, Israel had no homeland, no priesthood and temple, no son of David to lead them in spreading God’s kingdom. Yet, despite these terrible conditions, God’s prophets reassured Israel that one day a great son of David would rise and lead Israel in spreading God’s kingdom to the ends of the earth.

Time will only allow us to highlight three crucial steps in the progress of God’s kingdom in Old Testament Israel: the time of promise; the events of the exodus and conquest; and the time when Israel became a full-fledged empire.

Let’s look first at what took place during the period of God’s promise.

## Promise

When we speak of the period of promise, we have in mind the generations of Israel’s patriarchs. During the days of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Jacob’s sons, God made many promises about the future of the nation. These promises divide into two basic categories that correspond to the original goals God set before his image in the Garden of Eden: promises of Israel’s multiplication and promises of Israel’s dominion.

In the first place, much like God called Adam and Eve to fill the earth with their descendants, God promised Israel’s patriarchs that their descendants would one day multiply beyond number. Listen to God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 15:5:

> “Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be” (Genesis 15:5).

Here God promised that Abraham and his descendants would be as numerous as the stars in the sky. This is why the book of Genesis stresses the birth of Isaac, Abraham’s miracle child through Sarah. It’s also why the biblical story focuses so much on Isaac’s son Jacob and on Jacob’s twelve sons. Israel’s numerical increase is a central theme in the period of Israel’s patriarchs because God ordained Israel to fulfill the original commission he gave to Adam and Eve.

In the second place, the biblical stories about the patriarchs also focus on Israel’s dominion over the earth. Much like God placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, God promised that Abraham’s descendants would possess the land of Canaan. As God said to Abraham in Genesis 15:7:

> I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess (Genesis 15:7).

This is why the Scriptures reveal that Abraham purchased a symbolic piece of land in Canaan as a burial site for his family. It also explains why God commanded Jacob to return to his homeland, even as he faced great danger from his brother Esau.

The book of Genesis closes with Joseph assuring his brothers that they would leave Egypt and return to the Promised Land. The patriarchal period was a time when God promised that he would multiply Israel into a great nation and give dominion over the Promised Land to Israel.

After the period of promise for Israel’s patriarchs, the progress of God’s kingdom continued in the time of the exodus and conquest.
