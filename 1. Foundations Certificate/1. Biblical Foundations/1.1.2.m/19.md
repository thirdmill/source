## Christ

In many circles, Christians have little awareness of why the second person of the Trinity, the eternal Logos, became flesh. We rightly affirm that Jesus is fully God and fully man, but we often focus almost entirely on Christ’s deity. And as a result, Christ’s followers today often find it difficult to articulate why the second person of the eternal Trinity became one of us. Why was Jesus’ incarnation necessary? The New Testament’s answer is straightforward: Jesus became a man to fulfill the critical role that God had ordained for his image from the beginning.

There are many ways the New Testament highlights this significance of Christ’s humanity, but we’ll look in just two directions: first, the New Testament teaching that Jesus is the last Adam; and second, the fact that Jesus is God’s priest and king from the house of David. So, what does the New Testament mean when it says that Jesus is the last Adam?

### Last Adam.

Nearly every student of Scripture knows that the apostle Paul drew a parallel between Adam and Christ. In Romans 5:12-21 and other passages, Paul taught that Adam’s sin was so significant in God’s eyes that he condemned the human race to futility and eternal judgment. But, as Paul also explained, Jesus’ perfect obedience to God through his suffering and death on the cross was so significant in God’s eyes that he brought eternal life for all who believe in him. Listen to 1 Corinthians 15:21-22 and the way Paul emphasized the significance of Jesus’ humanity in this regard. Paul wrote:

> For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive (1 Corinthians 15:21-22).

We are so accustomed to thinking of salvation as a free gift of God’s grace that many of us might have expected Paul to write something like this: For as by a man came death, by the grace of God has come also the resurrection of the dead. Now, this would certainly be true because salvation in Christ is by God’s grace. But it is not what the apostle stressed here.

Rather, Paul wrote that just as death came through a man — namely Adam — resurrection from the dead, the goal of salvation, also comes through a man — Christ. As the first human being, the first image of God, Adam failed to serve God’s kingdom purposes and brought death to us all. But God never overturned his decree that his kingdom would come to earth through human beings. So, it was necessary for a man — a righteous, perfectly obedient image of God — to accomplish what Adam failed to do. For thousands of years, God’s faithful people prayed for such a man. And Christ is the righteous man who brings salvation, who brings resurrection life in God’s kingdom for all who believe in him.

God’s plan was for a man — a righteous, perfectly obedient image of God — to accomplish God’s kingdom purpose.

> Jesus is the perfect image of God. Jesus is the second Adam, as we read in 1 Corinthians 15:45, the “last Adam,” who was the very power of God. And God’s extraordinary power was demonstrated in Jesus’ perfection because he became a human being who did not commit sin, a human being who was not born from sin. If we look at Matthew 1:19- 20, we see that Jesus’ spirit did not come from Joseph or Mary or the lineage of Adam, but from the Holy Spirit. So, his life was a life that was perfect from within; his holiness was perfect from within, even as he wore human flesh and blood. — Yohanes Praptowarso, Ph.D.

Now in addition to being the last Adam, the New Testament also emphasizes that Christ serves as God’s priest and king in the last stages of the kingdom.

### Priest and King.

You’ll recall that Adam and Eve first served God as royal priests. And God called the nation of Israel to lead the whole human race in service to him as his kingdom of priests. We’ve also seen that, as Israel grew into a full-fledged kingdom, God anointed priests and kings, especially David and his dynasty to serve as his royal priests.

This is why the writer of Hebrews repeatedly stressed Christ’s royal priesthood. As he wrote in Hebrews 4:14:

> We have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God (Hebrews 4:14).

Jesus offered himself as final sacrifice for sin when he died on the cross. He took on himself the judgment of God on behalf of all who believe in him.

In addition to this, the New Testament also emphasizes that Jesus, the righteous Anointed One of David’s house, is seated forever on David’s throne. Listen to the way the angel Gabriel announced Jesus’ birth to Mary in Luke 1:32-33:

> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end (Luke 1:32-33).

Because Christ perfectly fulfilled the royal priesthood of the house of David, under his leadership the kingdom of God will never end. God’s kingdom purposes will be fulfilled through Jesus’ reign.

As we consider the people of God’s kingdom in the New Testament age, Christ is, without question, the supreme image of God who fulfills the service that God gave to Adam, to Israel and to David’s house. But, the New Testament also stresses that all true believers are joined to Christ, so that the church now serves as the people of God’s kingdom as well.
