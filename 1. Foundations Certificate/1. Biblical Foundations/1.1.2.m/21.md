# PROGRESS

In many ways, the progress of the kingdom of God in the New Testament is one of the most radical teachings that we find in the Scriptures. It was so radical that the vast majority of Jews in the first century rejected Jesus as Messiah. Now, there were many sects and divisions among the Jews in Jesus’ day. Most of us have heard of them: the Pharisees and the Sadducees who held power in Jerusalem, the Zealots who sought to overthrow the Romans with violence, and a number of disenfranchised desert communities. Despite their many differences, they all hoped that the Messiah would soon appear and bring the rapid and decisive victory of God’s kingdom over evil throughout the world. But Jesus and his first century apostles and prophets challenged this widespread expectation. They announced something that had been hidden until Jesus himself explained it: Jesus is the Messiah, but he is going to bring the kingdom of God to earth over a long period of time.

Listen to Matthew 13:31-32 and the way Jesus explained how the kingdom of God was coming to earth:

> The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree (Matthew 13:31-32).

The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed.

In this parable, Jesus declared that instead of coming suddenly and catastrophically, the kingdom of God would begin small, like a mustard seed. But in time, the kingdom would grow and spread to become like a large mustard plant. As the rest of the New Testament tells us, the kingdom began in a relatively small and quiet way with Jesus’ earthly ministry. But in the end, when Christ returns, his kingdom will extend over the entire earth.

In line with this teaching, we’ll speak of the progress of God’s kingdom in the New Testament age as unfolding in three main stages.

The first stage was the inauguration of the kingdom that took place in the ministries of Christ and his first century apostles and prophets. Over 2000 years ago, Jesus inaugurated the final victorious stage of God’s glorious kingdom on earth. This is why, in Ephesians 2:20, the apostle Paul spoke of the church as being, “built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.”

We may call the second stage of God’s kingdom in Christ the continuation of the kingdom. This is the long period of time in which the kingdom of God grows throughout church history. During this time, Christ continues to enlarge his kingdom through the proclamation of the gospel throughout the world. And he calls his followers to make spreading the kingdom of God their highest priority. Just as Jesus declared in Matthew 6:33:

> Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness (Matthew 6:33).

Every day of our lives we are to seek the expansion of God’s kingdom, God’s righteous rule throughout the entire world.

The third stage of God’s kingdom in Christ is the future consummation of the kingdom. This is the time when Christ returns and fulfills God’s plan to turn the whole world into his kingdom. Listen to the way John described this final phase of the kingdom of God in Revelation 11:15:

> The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever” (Revelation 11:15).

When Christ returns to the earth, he will defeat every enemy of God, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and of his Christ. And from that time forth “he shall reign everywhere, forever and ever.”

As followers of Christ, we look back to all that he accomplished in the inauguration of the kingdom. We place our faith and hope in Jesus’ life, death, resurrection, and ascension, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit that took place two thousand years ago. We also set our faith and hope in what Christ is doing during the continuation of the kingdom. Under the leadership of the ascended Christ, and in the power of the Holy Spirit, the church has continued to spread the good news throughout the nations. And of course, we place our faith and hope in what Christ will do in the future at the consummation of the kingdom. Christ will return in glory and bring in the fullness of the new creation filled with the glory of God.
