# CONCLUSION

In this lesson, we’ve introduced the unifying theme that ties together everything that appears in the Old Testament: the kingdom of God. We’ve seen how all Old Testament authors believed in a broad sense that God has always been and always will be the unsurpassed sovereign over history. But they also believed in a narrow sense that the reign of God will be manifest over time so that God’s commands will be done on earth as they are in heaven. Reaching this goal of history began in the primeval history. It extended to God’s work in the history of the nation of Israel. And this goal for history is fulfilled in Christ in the New Testament age.

Everyone who’s studied the Old Testament knows that it can be confusing. So, it’s always important to keep the big picture in mind. All Old Testament authors shared a common set of beliefs about the kingdom of God and they wrote their books to further the kingdom of God on earth. They knew that God created the world to become his kingdom, and that he will fill it with his glory, and that one day he will receive endless praise from every creature. God will accomplish this end through human beings, his images. And despite the challenges of evil, this kingdom will not fail. At every turn, the Old Testament anticipates that Jesus is the one who fulfills this purpose of God. Jesus will bring the kingdom of God to earth. And he will grant all who have faith in him the joy of reigning with him in that glorious kingdom forever.
