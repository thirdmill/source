## INTRODUCTION

If you were a great king in the ancient world, and you were determined to spread your rule over other nations, how would you administer your kingdom? How would you establish the fundamental policies of your empire as it grew larger and larger? These are good questions to ask as we study the Old Testament because the Old Testament presents God as the supreme divine King who is determined to spread his kingdom to the ends of the earth. Ancient Israelites knew that great human kings in their day ruled their expanding kingdoms through international treaties or covenants. So, it was no surprise to them to learn that God administered his expanding kingdom through covenants as well. God’s covenants established the basic policies that governed his kingdom as it spread throughout the earth. 
This is the third lesson in our series Kingdom, Covenants & Canon of the Old Testament, and we’ve entitled it, “Divine Covenants.” In this lesson, we’ll explore how God governed his kingdom through a series of covenants to advance his kingdom throughout the world. 
As we’re learning in this series, the books of the Old Testament canon were written to address God’s people in a variety of times and circumstances. Yet, the outlooks of each book rested on a set of beliefs that all Old Testament authors held in common. They all believed that God’s grand purpose in history was to expand his kingdom from heaven to the ends of the earth. And they also believed that God administered the expansion of his kingdom in different time periods through a series of major covenants. In effect, Old Testament authors wrote their books to further God’s kingdom by applying his covenant policies to the challenges of different situations. And for this reason, understanding God’s covenants is crucial to grasping the significance of every portion of the Old Testament. 
Our exploration of divine covenants in the Old Testament will divide into four main parts. First, we’ll investigate the crucial connections between God’s kingdom and his covenants. Second, we’ll look into the history of God’s covenants in the Old Testament. Third, we’ll examine the dynamics of life in these covenants. And fourth, we’ll explore the people of God’s covenants. Let’s start with the connections between God’s kingdom and his covenants.



### KINGDOM AND COVENANTS

Everyone familiar with the Old Testament knows that the concept of covenant was crucial to the faith of Israel. The Hebrew term usually translated “covenant” — berîth in Hebrew — appears more than 280 times in the Old Testament. And this concept of covenant is often associated with other terminology as well. The prominence of covenants in the Old Testament is undeniable. But sadly, many people misunderstand the basic features of God’s covenants in the Scriptures. They fail to see how God’s covenants were inextricably linked to his rule as the divine king and to the growth of his kingdom on earth. How then did divine covenants relate to God’s kingdom? What’s the association between these two crucial teachings of the Old Testament?
To explore the connections between God’s kingdom purposes and his covenants, we’ll look in two directions. First, we’ll mention some recent archaeological discoveries that provide valuable backgrounds for understanding these connections. And second, we’ll see how these discoveries offer significant insights into the biblical concept of divine covenants. Let’s begin with some recent archaeological discoveries that shed light on our subject.


#### ARCHEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES

Christ’s followers rightly affirm that the Holy Spirit inspired the Old Testament Scriptures and that they are the Word of God for all times and places. But it’s always important to keep in mind that the Holy Spirit inspired these Scriptures in the first place for ancient Israelites. The cultural experiences of ancient Israelites set the stage for them to understand the revelation of God in their day. And as we’re about to see, a number of archeological discoveries made in the second half of the last century help us grasp how faithful Israelites understood that there were fundamental connections between God’s covenants and his kingdom.
Three types of royal documents from the ancient Near East often appear in discussions of biblical covenants: first, royal parity treaties — covenants in which kings of relatively equal status negotiated the terms of their relationships with each other; second, royal grants — writings that reveal how ancient kings formally bestowed lands or special status to their faithful servants; and third, suzerain-vassal treaties and other documents associated with them — international agreements that great kings established with lesser, subservient kings and their nations. 
In reality, we can only garner a few insights into divine covenants in the Bible from royal parity treaties. To be sure, the Old Testament refers to human beings of equal status who mutually negotiated the terms of covenants between them. But, in regard to divine covenants, God never negotiated with human beings because no human being is his equal. In every instance, he sovereignly dictated all the terms of his covenants. 
Beyond this, biblical scholars have pointed to some significant parallels between God’s covenants in the Bible and royal grants. They’ve noted, especially, connections that focus on Israel’s inheritance of the Promised Land and God’s choice of David’s house as Israel’s royal dynasty. But, as we’ll see later, these parallels have often been misunderstood. 
By far, the ancient royal documents that have expanded our understanding of biblical divine covenants most are suzerain-vassal treaties. These ancient writings offer significant insights into how biblical authors understood the relationship between God’s kingdom and his covenants.
In the Old Testament world, the Pharaohs of Egypt, and the kings of the Hittites, Babylonians, Assyrians and even of Israel often extended their territories by conquering or annexing weaker kingdoms. And when they did this, they established the foundational policies of their expanding kingdoms through treaties or covenants. Archeologists have discovered a number of these international treaties and have referred to them as “suzerain-vassal treaties.”

Now, don’t let the terms “suzerain” and “vassal” confuse you. “Suzerain” simply means an emperor or a great king. And of course, the term “vassal” means servant, or in this case, “servant of the great king.” Suzerain-vassal treaties established the basic policies that governed the interactions between great kings — suzerains — and lesser kings — vassals — and their nations. So, a suzerain-vassal treaty was an international agreement made between a great emperor and a lesser king and his nation. 

> Kingship in the ancient Near Eastern context … was largely grounded in the concept of covenant. So, we have evidence of treaties, ancient treaties, in which a king, or an overlord, or what’s called a “suzerain” would then enter into an agreement with some people who become essentially his servants or his vassals. And they define the relationship such that the overlord, the suzerain, defines a set of terms by which a relationship can be maintained. And he’d say something like this: “I will offer you protection; I will offer you prosperity; I will offer you identity in exchange for your participation with me by sharing a portion of your crops, by giving me your allegiance, and by not forming allegiances with other kings” or overlords. And so, it tended to be a very mutual sort of a circumstance in one sense. And if we begin to think about kingship and the nature of covenant in the terms of this kind of an agreement, then what we find is that various portions of the Old Testament seem to conform very precisely with the exact elements of these suzerain treaties.

Suzerain-vassal treaties typically contained seven main elements. They began with a preamble that identified the great king. This preamble was followed by a historical prologue that focused on the great king’s kind deeds toward his vassals. Next, these treaties turned to specific stipulations or laws that kings required their vassals to obey. Following these rules, there were usually provisions made for annual public readings and renewals of these treaties, and lists of divine witnesses that called on the gods to ensure that all obligations were met. These treaties then turned to blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. And they usually closed with references to a ceremonial, sacrificial meal that formalized these international relationships. 
Significant parallels exist between all seven of these elements and divine covenants throughout the Old Testament. But rather than touching on each of these elements, we’ll highlight the ways biblical covenants paralleled the underlying dynamics of these treaties.
The seven typical elements of suzerain-vassal treaties revealed an underlying, threefold dynamic that characterized the interactions between great kings and their vassals.

First, the treaties emphasized royal benevolence — the kindness that great kings showed to their vassals. In the preamble, the king would identify himself as the rightful ruler. Then the historical prologue would describe specific ways the king had shown kindness to his vassals. The theme of royal benevolence was so prominent that great kings often called themselves “father” and their vassals “sons.”
The second major focus of suzerain-vassal treaties was on the requirements of vassal loyalty. Vassals were to observe the laws of the king and offer tributes of precious metals, jewels, slaves, soldiers and portions of their harvests. These stipulations were spelled out so that vassals could demonstrate that they were grateful, loyal servants of their great kings. 
The third major focus of suzerain-vassal treaties was on the consequences of blessings and curses. Great kings always reserved their royal prerogative to mete out blessings and curses in ways that served their kingdom purposes. But in suzerain-vassal treaties, kings proclaimed blessings that would come to their faithful vassals and warned of curses that would come to unfaithful vassals. 
As we’ll see, these three central features of suzerain-vassal treaties help us understand more clearly the fundamental dynamics of the relationship between God and his covenant people in Scripture. 
With these archaeological discoveries in mind, we should turn to the biblical insights they give us in regard to the vital connections between God’s kingdom and his covenants.
