### BIBLICAL INSIGHTS

We should mention from the outset that the Old Testament describes many different relationships as covenants — relationships between friends, spouses, political leaders, tribes and nations. These human interactions were called covenants in the Old Testament because they formally bound people to each other with mutual obligations. At times, the Old Testament compares these diverse covenant relationships to God’s relationship with his people. So, we can learn much about our relationship with God from these different kinds of covenants in the Old Testament.

We have in mind here six well-known, biblical covenants: God’s covenants in Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and a future covenant that we often call the new covenant. In all of these instances, God directed his kingdom through covenants. 
We’ll look at each of these major divine covenants later in this lesson. But at this point, we’ll illustrate how suzerain-vassal treaties give us insights into the nature of God’s covenants by looking briefly at his covenant in Moses. Looking at God’s covenant with Moses is important because the Scriptures reveal so much more about this covenant than any other covenant in the Old Testament. 
When we look at the covenant God made with Moses, it quickly becomes apparent that it was structured in ways that resembled ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaties. Moses’ covenant consisted of the same three elements that we’ve seen in these treaties. And this resemblance helps us understand that, in a fundamental sense, God, the great King of Israel, established his covenants to administer his kingdom. 
Consider Exodus 19:4-6 where God initiated his covenant with the nation of Israel at Mount Sinai. God said: 

> You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exodus 19:4-6).

This passage introduces a lengthy record of God’s covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai that extends from Exodus 19–24. Notice that it explicitly refers to God making “covenant” with Israel and that it connects this covenant with his kingdom. As we see here, this covenant was designed to serve God’s kingdom purposes by making Israel a “kingdom of priests.”
In this same passage, we can also see the basic threefold dynamic of royal benevolence, vassal loyalty, and the consequences of blessings and curses that characterized suzerain-vassal treaties. 
First, God reminded the Israelites of the divine benevolence he’d shown when he delivered them from slavery in Egypt. As he said in verse 4:

> You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself (Exodus 19:4).

Much like ancient human kings, God reminded the Israelites that he had done great things for them. His benevolence was essential to the relationship he established with Israel through his covenant at Mount Sinai. 
Second, God also called for human loyalty as he initiated this covenant. Listen again to verse 5:

> Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples (Exodus 19:5).

Much like ancient Near Eastern suzerains, God required loyalty from the people of his kingdom. Although Moses’ covenant was initiated and sustained by God’s royal benevolence, God still required his people to obey his voice and to keep the stipulations of his covenant. 
Third, Moses’ covenant also entailed consequences for Israel. This element becomes clear in verses 5-6: 

> Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exodus 19:5-6).

As Israel’s divine king, God made it clear that if the Israelites were faithful, they would receive great blessings. They would be his treasured possession above all other nations. They would become a kingdom of priests to God, a holy nation. And as Exodus 19–24 illustrates time and again, if the Israelites were unfaithful, they would fall under God’s curses. 
It would be difficult to deny these crucial parallels between suzerain-vassal treaties and God’s covenant with Israel in the days of Moses. But in recent decades, a number of biblical interpreters have argued that some of the other major biblical covenants more closely parallel royal grants. In their view, royal grants didn’t include the requirement of loyalty and the consequences of blessings and curses. And in this light, these interpreters have argued that God’s covenants in Adam and Moses were like suzerain-vassal treaties; they were conditional, obligatory covenants. But from this outlook, God’s covenants in Noah, Abraham and David — and in some views even the new covenant — were like royal grants that were entirely unconditional, promissory covenants.
But viewing some biblical covenants as obligatory and others as promissory is inadequate. It’s true that some archeological examples of royal grants don’t explicitly mention the requirement of loyalty or blessings and curses. But many scholars have pointed out that a number of them do. And these scholars also rightly observe that kings in the ancient Near East always required obedience from their subjects. Every divine covenant established relationships between God as the king and his people as his vassals. So, every biblical passage that refers to God’s covenants directly addressed or presupposed divine benevolence, human loyalty and the consequences of blessings and curses. 

> Sometimes biblical scholars have suggested that some covenants are promissory and others are obligatory; that the land that’s given to Abraham is a promissory covenant, and the law that’s given at Sinai is an obligatory covenant. But actually, what we see in the Bible and in the ancient Near East is that every covenant has both sides to it. Promises are being made, but also, it comes with an expectation of caring for and maintaining the relationship. So, we see that even in the land grant treaty where God gives Abraham land. Right after that, in chapter 17 and chapter 18 there’s this expectation that, “You will walk before me, and you will teach your children my ways. You will walk in righteousness and in justice.” So, God gives great gifts in his covenant, but also there is this expectation of love, of loyalty, of devotion to the Great King.

Now that we’ve introduced the fundamental connection between God’s kingdom and his covenants, let’s turn to our second main topic in this lesson: the history of the covenants in the Old Testament.
