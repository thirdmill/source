## HISTORY OF THE COVENANTS

The Old Testament provides us with historical records of how God’s kingdom developed on the earth before the incarnation of Christ. And these Scriptures reveal that in the days of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and David, and then later in the new covenant, God dramatically intervened in history to make covenants. Now, all of these covenants were designed to administer the expansion of God’s kingdom. But they emphasized different policies that were appropriate for God’s kingdom at different stages in history.

There are many ways to describe the history of divine covenants in the Old Testament. But we’ll divide God’s covenants into three groups: first, God’s early universal covenants; second, his national covenants with Israel; and third, the new covenant — the covenant that Old Testament prophets predicted would unfold at the climax of history. Let’s turn first to the universal covenants.


### UNIVERSAL COVENANTS

When we speak of the covenants with Adam and Noah as “universal,” we have in mind that God made them with all of humanity in the primeval history before he chose Israel as his special people. In this sense, when we ask “To whom has God shown benevolence? Who is obligated to be loyal to God? Who stands to receive the consequences of his blessings and curses?” The answer is: every person who has ever lived. All images of God are in covenant with God because they are bound to him through his covenants with Adam and Noah.

> So, these two covenants, with Adam and with Noah, make wonderful promises to mankind. The first one is that God will send the seed of a woman, one of Eve’s descendants, a human being who will be our Savior; this is the God-man Jesus Christ. And he promises Noah that despite how wicked the world becomes — and it is increasingly becoming more wicked as time goes on — he will never again destroy it with some catastrophic flood or some natural judgment as he did in the days of Noah… So, these two covenants with Adam and with Noah … look at a much broader audience and a broader work of God in the salvation of the world than even the more national covenants with Abraham and Moses and David.

We’ll look at these universal covenants in chronological order, beginning with God’s covenant in Adam and then moving to his covenant in the days of Noah. Let’s consider first God’s covenant in Adam. 

#### Adam

The historical record of God’s covenant with humanity in Adam appears in Genesis 1–3. As we all know, Adam was the first human being, so we’re referring to the earliest period of human history. Not surprisingly, we find that the Bible’s teaching about Adam’s covenant focuses on some of the most basic or foundational dimensions of human interaction with God. 
Now, we should mention that the word “covenant” does not appear in the first three chapters of Genesis. And for this reason, some Christians don’t agree that God made a formal covenant with Adam. Even so, three pieces of evidence strongly suggest that God did, in fact, make his first covenant with Adam as the representative of humanity. 
First, as we’ll see later in this lesson, the basic dynamics of divine covenants — benevolence, human loyalty, and the consequences of blessings and curses — appear throughout Genesis 1–3.
A second evidence that God entered into covenant with Adam appears in Hosea 6:7. There we read these words:

> Like Adam [or humanity] they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me (Hosea 6:7). 

This passage compares Israel’s rebellion against God in the days of Hosea with Adam’s sin in the Garden of Eden. And it speaks of how Israel had transgressed, or broken, God’s covenant, just like Adam had in his day. 
A third evidence that God entered into a covenant with Adam appears in Genesis 6:18. This is the first passage in the Bible where the term “covenant” — or berith (בְּרִית) in Hebrew — actually occurs. Here, God spoke to Noah in this way: 

> I will establish my covenant with you (Genesis 6:18). 

This passage is significant because it doesn’t use the normal terminology for initiating a covenant. Normally, the Hebrew verb karath (כָּרַת) — which literally means “to cut” — was used to describe making a new covenant. But the word translated “establish” here is from the Hebrew verb qum (קוּם) which means “to confirm” or to establish a covenant that has already been initiated. When God said to Noah that he was about to establish his covenant with him, he meant that he was about to confirm an existing covenant — namely the covenant God had made previously with Adam.
The covenant that God made in the days of Adam addressed the most fundamental features of God’s interactions with humanity. For this reason, we may call it God’s “covenant of foundations.” In this covenant, God set the fundamental patterns of life for all human beings. Adam and Eve were ordained to serve as God’s royal and priestly images and to spread his kingdom to the ends of the earth. God tested their loyalty. And he offered great blessings to Adam and Eve, if they obeyed him. But their disloyalty led to the consequences of divine curses. In short, the covenant with Adam established the foundations of our role in his kingdom.
Following God’s covenant in Adam, the second universal covenant is God’s covenant in the days of Noah. There’s much that could be said about this covenant, but we’ll simply touch on some of the central issues that come to the foreground in the biblical account. 

#### Noah

God’s covenant with Noah was also established in the primeval period of God’s kingdom and concerned some of the most basic issues that face all of humanity. The covenant in Noah is first mentioned before the flood in Genesis 6, and then again after the flood in chapter 9. Listen to what God said in Genesis 6:18:

> I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you (Genesis 6:18). 

Before the flood, God promised by covenant that if Noah met the conditions of building the ark and bringing the animals into the ark, he would rescue Noah and his family. After the flood, in Genesis 9:9-11, we see a renewal of God’s covenant in Noah. In this passage, God told Noah:

> I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you, and with every living creature that is with you … never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood (Genesis 9:9-11).

As we see here, God’s covenant in Noah was not simply made with Noah and his offspring and “every living creature” that was in the ark. God insured that “never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood.”
God made his covenant with Noah after humanity’s rebellion against God had brought the great flood of God’s judgment. But after the flood, God’s covenant with Noah ensured the stability of the created order. And for this reason, we may refer to it as God’s “covenant of stability.” When Noah and his family left the ark, God acknowledged humanity’s propensity toward sin. And by covenant, he set in place a long-term strategy so that sinful human beings would be able to fulfill his kingdom purposes. As we read in Genesis 8:21-22: 

> The Lord said … “I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man’s heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease” (Genesis 8:21-22). 

To advance his kingdom, God promised that nature would remain stable so that sinful human beings could have opportunity to fulfill their service to him. This universal covenant, like the covenant with Adam, established basic kingdom policies that still apply to all people in all places and at all times. 
As we’ve just seen, the history of God’s major covenants began with universal covenants in Adam and Noah. Now, we should turn our attention to the national covenants — covenants that God made when Old Testament Israel moved to the center stage of his kingdom purposes.
