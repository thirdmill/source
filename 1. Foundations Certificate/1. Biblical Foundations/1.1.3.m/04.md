### NATIONAL COVENANTS

We’ll also look at the national covenants in chronological order, beginning with the covenant in Abraham, then the covenant with Israel in Moses and finally the covenant in David. Let’s start with God’s covenant in Abraham.

#### Abraham

Abraham was the patriarch or father of every Israelite. And for this reason, God made his first national covenant through Abraham. We find direct references to this covenant in Genesis 15, 17. The first mention of God’s covenant with Abraham — or “Abram” as he was called then — appears in Genesis 15:18:

> On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram (Genesis 15:18). 

Here the expression “made a covenant” is literally “cut a covenant,” using the Hebrew term karath (כָּרַת). As we mentioned earlier, this was the normal way of indicating the beginning of a covenant relationship. Then, a number of years later, God affirmed or renewed his covenant with the Patriarch. In Genesis 17:1-2 we read these words:

> I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless. I will confirm my covenant between me and you (Genesis 17:1-2, NIV). 

This is not a second, different covenant with Abraham. Rather, God said that he would “confirm” his covenant between himself and Abraham. The word “confirm” translates the Hebrew verb qum (קוּם). This is the same expression that we saw in Genesis 6:18 when God established, or confirmed, the covenant with Adam in his covenant with Noah. 

> God, whenever he speaks of it, he speaks of, “my covenant with Abraham.” He never refers to more than one. And he can even refer — when he’s reaffirming that covenant with Isaac and Jacob — he can refer to “the oath I swore to Abraham,” for instance, which is standing for the whole covenant, and it includes all the promises made in Genesis 12, 15, 17 and 22. And Peter makes similar remarks at Pentecost. And so, the biblical take on it, one would never think from the way the Bible refers to it that there’s more than one covenant… I think any other interpretation, then, becomes a bit forced because all of the evidence most naturally invites the understanding that God only made one covenant with Abraham.

The covenant with Abraham set his descendants apart from the rest of humanity. Through this covenant, God chose Israel to take a leading role in spreading his kingdom throughout the world. Abraham’s descendants would possess the Promised Land. They would increase in number. And they would spread the kingdom of God to the ends of the earth. And for this reason, Abraham’s covenant may be described as both God’s covenant of promise to Israel and his “covenant of Israel’s election.” As we read in Genesis 15:18: 

> On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your offspring I give this land” (Genesis 15:18) 

And in Genesis 17:2: 

> I will confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers (Genesis 17:2, NIV). 

God’s covenant with Abraham established God’s kingdom purposes for Israel as his chosen people.
After God had made his covenant with Abraham, God made another national covenant — the covenant with Israel in Moses. 


#### Moses

It’s important to realize that Israel’s covenant in the days of Moses was not contrary to God’s covenant with Abraham. Moses did not see himself as providing an alternative to God’s covenant with Abraham. On the contrary, Moses frequently appealed to the covenant with Abraham as the basis of his own kingdom work. Listen to the way Moses pleaded with God on behalf of the nation in Exodus 32:13: 

> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, “I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever” (Exodus 32:13).

As we see here, the national covenant with Moses was not a brand-new covenant that replaced the covenant with Abraham. Rather, it was built on and furthered the covenant of election that God had made with Abraham.
We find the primary record of God entering covenant with Israel in the days of Moses in Exodus 19–24. We also find a renewal of this covenant with the second generation of the exodus in the book of Deuteronomy. As God gathered the twelve tribes of Israel at the foot of Mount Sinai, he shaped them into a great nation, a politically unified people. Of course, there had been rules and regulations for God’s people before the time of Moses. But like every new nation, one of Israel’s chief needs at this time was a system of laws, a body of regulations to govern them. For this reason, the covenant with Moses may rightly be called God’s “covenant of law.” In fact, Moses’ covenant stressed the law so much that when the people of Israel entered this covenant, they made a solemn commitment to keep all of God’s law. In Exodus 19:7-8 we’re told:

> So Moses … set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him. All the people answered together and said, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do” (Exodus 19:7-8). 

So, we see that the second covenant with the nation of Israel was the covenant with Moses, a covenant that stressed precisely what the nation needed at this time, the law of God.
Now, after looking at God’s covenants with Abraham and Moses, we should turn to Israel’s last national covenant in the Old Testament. 

#### David

When Israel became a full-fledged kingdom, God made a covenant with king David. God’s covenant with David was not out of accord with God’s covenant at Mount Sinai. Rather, it was built on and furthered the covenant with Moses. As Solomon made clear in 2 Chronicles 6:16, God’s promises to David were dependent on faithfulness to Moses’ law. As we read: 

> Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, “You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me”
(2 Chronicles 6:16). 

As this passage indicates, God’s covenant with David focused on the royal house of David, but David’s house was required “to walk in [God’s] law” — the law of Moses. 
Typically, biblical interpreters suggest that God made this covenant at the height of David’s reign in 2 Samuel 7. Even though this chapter doesn’t use the word “covenant,” several passages refer explicitly to the fact that God made a covenant with David. As just one example, listen to God’s promise to David in Psalm 89:3-4:

> I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant: “I will establish your offspring forever, and build your throne for all generations” (Psalm 89:3-4).

As we see here, David’s covenant focused on kingship in Israel. Or to be more specific, it established David’s house as the permanent royal dynasty “for all generations” of Israel. 

> God’s promise to David in 2 Samuel 7 is of great significance for redemptive history. This is a pivotal chapter in understanding the history of redemption in general… We see in this chapter what is called the Davidic covenant. It’s a very important covenant in which we see a new perspective on the Savior, that this Savior will be the son of David. The term “son of David” is not an ordinary term in Scripture. Each time you see “son of David,” it’s necessary to remember the word “king.” David was the king, and in this chapter, the Lord promised him that his son would sit on the throne — the throne of the kingdom — forever. One of David’s offspring would be the king forever on David’s throne.
— Mr. Sherif Atef Fahim, translation 

When David became king over God’s people, God advanced his kingdom by establishing David’s house as the line that would rule over Israel in perpetuity. From that time forward, it was through the faithful rule of David’s house that Israel would fulfill its role in spreading God’s kingdom to the ends of the earth. For this reason, we may call David’s covenant God’s “covenant of kingship.” 
Now that we’ve seen how the history of God’s covenants includes universal and national covenants, we should look at the new covenant, the covenant that Old Testament prophets predicted God would make during the final stage of his kingdom.
