## DYNAMICS OF THE COVENANTS

As we mentioned earlier in this lesson, some interpreters have denied that the basic dynamics of divine benevolence, human loyalty and the consequences of blessings and curses appear in all divine covenants. It’s true that the biblical record of each Old Testament covenant has distinctive emphases. Yet, when we keep in view the broader biblical portrait of Old Testament history, we can see that the dynamics of God’s interactions with his people remained consistent under each administration of each covenant.

Adam’s covenant stressed certain foundational patterns established at the commencement of the world. Noah’s covenant emphasized the stability of nature. Abraham’s covenant accentuated God’s promises and election. Moses’ covenant emphasized God’s law. David’s covenant highlighted the Davidic dynasty as God’s specially-chosen royal family. And the new covenant stressed fulfillment. 
But these emphases are not comprehensive descriptions of covenant life; they merely touch on certain highlights. To see a fuller picture of the dynamics of living in covenant we must recognize that life in covenant with God involved much more than these emphases. The dynamics of living in covenant with God always involve the benevolence of God, the requirement of human loyalty, and consequences for human loyalty and disloyalty. 
Having said this, it’s important never to think of these covenant dynamics as operating mechanically, as if God’s implementation of covenant dynamics was always predictable. Rather, God always reserved his royal prerogative as he dealt with individuals, groups and humanity as a whole. He exercised his right as the king to implement the dynamics of his covenants in ways that fulfilled his grand kingdom purposes. He showed benevolence when he saw fit. He stressed certain standards of loyalty according to his royal wisdom. He meted out blessings and curses at his own discretion. 
Often, we can’t fathom why God showed benevolence to some people and not to others. We struggle to understand why he considered some standards of loyalty more significant for some people than for others. At times, we’re unable to explain why God poured out blessings on some people and curses on others. Many times, Old Testament authors explained why God exercised his royal prerogative in this or that way. At other times, they did not. Still, we know that God is good and that his wisdom far surpasses our own. So, we humbly accept how he handled the basic dynamics of life in covenant with him. 
To unpack how the dynamics of God’s covenants permeate the Old Testament, we’ll touch briefly on each Old Testament covenant. First, we’ll look at the primeval universal covenants. Second, we’ll consider the national covenants God made with Old Testament Israel. And third we’ll look at the new covenant in Christ. Let’s look first at these dynamics in the universal covenants.

### UNIVERSAL COVENANTS

As you’ll recall, during the primeval history, God established a covenant of foundations with Adam and a covenant of natural stability with Noah. But God’s interactions with Adam didn’t simply amount to the establishment of kingdom foundations. And, under Noah’s covenant, interactions between humanity and God involved much more than the stability of nature. As in all divine covenants, God administered life under these covenants through the dynamics of divine benevolence, human loyalty, and consequences for obedience and disobedience.
We’ll look briefly at how this is true for each of the universal covenants; first in the covenant with Adam and then in the covenant with Noah. Let’s start with Adam.
