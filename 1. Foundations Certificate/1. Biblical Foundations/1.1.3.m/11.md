## PEOPLE OF THE COVENANTS

As God administered his kingdom through covenants, he always engaged with people. And this shouldn’t surprise us. Human beings are God’s royal, priestly images, created to spread his kingdom throughout the earth. But in reality, God’s covenants involved various kinds of people at different times. How does this variety appear in the Scriptures? And what difference does it make as we consider the people of God’s covenants?
To answer these questions, we’ll look at two issues. First, we’ll see how God’s covenants engaged different divisions of humanity in various ways. And second, we’ll see how these divisions impacted the application of covenant dynamics for the people of God’s covenants. Let’s look first at how God made covenants with different divisions of the human race. 

### DIVISIONS OF HUMANITY

Everyone familiar with the Old Testament knows that it often distinguishes between different sorts of individuals and groups of people — men and women, old and young, the powerful and the weak, to mention just a few. Now of course, it’s impossible for us to deal with all of this variety in detail. But it will help to focus on a number of large groups of people that often took center stage in what the Bible tells us about divine covenants. 
We’ll deal with these divisions of humanity first by noting how both believers and unbelievers are included within God’s covenants. Then we’ll see the division between people who are included and those who are excluded from God’s covenants. Let’s begin with the fact that there are both believers and unbelievers within God’s covenants. 

#### Within Covenants

Christians often assume that only true believers have ever entered into covenant with God, but this is hardly the case. You’ll remember that we spoke of God’s covenants in Adam and Noah as universal covenants because they bound all people to God. And once humanity fell into sin, this was true for both believers and unbelievers. The foundational principles of God’s kingdom established in Adam’s covenant applied to those who had saving faith, like Abel and Seth, and those who did not, like Cain and his murderous descendant Lamech. In much the same way, the covenant of stability in nature in the days of Noah also held for both believers, like Noah’s son Shem, as well as unbelievers, like Noah’s grandson Canaan. 
The same was true for Israel’s national covenants in Abraham, Moses and David. All the people of Israel were in covenant with God through these covenants, whether they had received eternal salvation or not. For instance, both Jacob and Esau were circumcised and in God’s covenant with Abraham. In Moses’ day every tribe of Israel had both believers and unbelievers within them as they entered into covenant at Mount Sinai. The same was true for God’s dynastic covenant with David. All of David’s descendants and the citizens of Israel were in covenant with God, whether they were true believers or not. 
Now we have to be careful when it comes to unbelievers in the new covenant. Old Testament prophecies about the new covenant indicate that it will only include true believers. Listen to the way Jeremiah described the people of the new covenant in Jeremiah 31:34:

> No longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, “Know the Lord,” for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more (Jeremiah 31:34).

As this passage reveals, every person counted in the new covenant will know the Lord and be permanently forgiven of their sins. None of their transgressions will ever be counted against them. 
Still, as we think about how Jeremiah’s prophecy was fulfilled, we must keep in mind a feature of the new covenant age that we’ve mentioned several times in this series. The New Testament explains that the new covenant in Christ is fulfilled in three stages. It was inaugurated in Christ’s first advent; it continues throughout the history of the church; and it will reach its consummation only when Christ returns in glory.
This unfolding of the new covenant age in three stages helps us understand that, until Christ returns, both believers and unbelievers are counted among God’s people. Both believers and unbelievers were among Christ’s followers during the inauguration of his kingdom. And the same is true throughout the continuation of Christ’s kingdom. The visible Christian church includes true believers who’ve actually received eternal salvation, and unbelievers who receive temporary blessings from their association with Christ and his church. 

> What is the visible church? It is the church universal, in the sense of the church throughout the world that consists of multiple local churches, multiple denominations, and some churches that don’t think of themselves as denominations at all… That is distinguished in theology from the invisible church. And the invisible church is the church not just that you can see but the church that you can’t see. Hebrews 12, the general assembly of the church of the firstborn, meaning those who have died and gone to heaven, meaning the elect who are now before the throne of God in the company of angels and archangels that ever was and ever shall be. The invisible church and the visible church make up the church of Jesus Christ.

Listen to the way the apostle John spoke of unbelievers in the church in 1 John 2:19: 

> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us (1 John 2:19).

Here the apostle wrote about people who leave the Christian faith. He acknowledged that, in one sense, they were counted as “us.” That is, they lived among the people of God. But John said also that, by leaving the faith, they made it clear that they were “not of us.” That is, they were not true believers. As he said, if they had really been true believers who had received eternal salvation in Christ, “they would have continued with us.” That is, they would have remained faithful to the end. 
We all know that the rosters of most churches include people who are true believers and people who are not. Jeremiah’s prophecy of a completely redeemed people of the new covenant will be fulfilled only when Christ returns. At that time, unbelievers among God’s covenant people will suffer the eternal judgment of God. And only true believers will remain to reign with Christ in the new creation. 
In addition to the divisions of humanity within divine covenants, the Old Testament record of God’s covenants also addresses the division between those who were included within and those who were excluded from God’s covenants during different periods of history.
