#### Included and Excluded

As we’ve already mentioned, all of humanity was included in the universal covenants with Adam and Noah. No groups were excluded from the foundations and natural stability established in these covenants. But this situation changed when God chose Israel as his special covenant people. The national covenants with Abraham, Moses and David primarily included the physical descendants of Abraham and only relatively few Gentiles who were adopted into Israel. For the most part, Gentile nations were excluded from Israel’s national covenants. Listen to Ephesians 2:12 and the way Paul described Gentiles before they became followers of Christ: 

> You were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world (Ephesians 2:12).

Gentiles were strangers to the covenants of promise. They were without hope and without God. So, during the centuries of Israel’s national covenants, there were actually three kinds of people in the world: true believers who were in Israel’s covenants, unbelievers who were in Israel’s covenants, and unbelieving Gentiles who were excluded from Israel’s covenants.
This threefold distinction is important because it also holds for the new covenant until Christ returns in glory. As we’ve seen, until that day, true believers are included in the new covenant along with unbelievers who are associated with the visible church. And during the New Testament period, there’s also a third category: men and women who have not acknowledged the gospel or the church. These people are excluded from the new covenant. During Old Testament history those outside of the covenant were primarily Gentiles. But now that Christ has come, those outside of the new covenant include both Jews and Gentiles who have no part in Christ or his church.

Now that we’ve seen how certain divisions of humanity are related to the people of God’s covenants, we’re ready to turn to the application of covenant dynamics to these groups. How have these categories of people experienced God’s benevolence, the requirement of human loyalty, and consequences of blessings and curses? 


### APPLICATION OF DYNAMICS

All people have experienced the dynamics of the universal covenants in Adam and Noah. The lives of all people have been directly impacted by the foundational policies established in Adam and the stability of nature established in Noah. Yet, the same is not true of Israel’s national covenants in Abraham, Moses and David. Nor is it true with the new covenant. 
As we consider the application of covenant dynamics to various groups, we need to see how the national covenants and the new covenant applied to three kinds of people: first unbelievers excluded from these covenants; second, unbelievers included in these covenants; and third, true believers included in these covenants. Let’s look first at unbelievers who have been excluded from Israel’s national covenants and from the new covenant. 


#### Unbelievers Excluded

Unbelievers who have no connection to the national covenants and the new covenant are nonetheless bound to God by his universal covenants in Adam and Noah. For this reason, they still experience the dynamics of these covenants. They receive God’s benevolence because God shows kindness to all people. As Jesus put it in Matthew 5:45: 

> Your Father who is in heaven… makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust (Matthew 5:45).

We often call these blessings “common grace” because they are not saving mercies. Rather, they are displays of God’s grace to all human beings.
 Beyond this, unbelievers outside Israel’s national covenants and the new covenant are still required to give God their loyal service according to the measure of revelation they’ve received. They may have some awareness of the special revelation given to Israel and the church. But even if they’ve never had contact with Israel or the Christian church, they still have a basic understanding of their obligations to God through general or natural revelation. 

> In Scripture, God tells us — and Paul gives this argument in Romans 1 — that it doesn’t matter who it is or of what culture, every human being who has ever existed has known about the existence of God… Paul said that every man knows that God exists by conscience. Man has a reason, he has a conscience, and through what has been created in the world, God’s divine nature has been clearly seen. So, all men know that God exists.
— Rev. Clete Hux

As Paul put it in Romans 1:20:

> [God’s] invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse (Romans 1:20).

General revelation has always obligated unbelievers outside the covenants with Israel and the new covenant to acknowledge and serve their Creator. 
As a result, these unbelievers also experience the consequences of blessings and curses as God sees fit. God often grants temporary blessings to unbelievers who never join with Israel or the Christian church. And he also pours out temporary curses on them as he determines. But the Scriptures are clear that at the great judgment, God’s temporary blessings and curses in this life will lead to God’s eternal curses for these unbelievers. 
Unlike unbelievers excluded from these covenants, the application of covenant dynamics takes place differently with those unbelievers who are included in God’s covenants with Israel and the new covenant. 

#### Unbelievers Included

To begin with, God has shown much benevolence to these people. True, they have not received eternal salvation, but still, God has shown great kindness to unbelievers who have been joined to God’s covenant people both in the Old and New Testaments. In Romans 9:4, the apostle Paul reflected on the advantages that even unbelievers in Israel enjoyed. He wrote: 

> To them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises (Romans 9:4).

God showed greater kindnesses to unbelievers who were in God’s covenants with Israel than to those outside of these covenants. And the same is true for unbelievers associated with the Christian church. 
In the Old Testament, both believers and unbelievers in Israel were physically delivered from slavery in Egypt. They all received the gift of God’s law at Mount Sinai. They all conquered the Land of Promise. They were blessed during the reigns of David and Solomon. And in much the same way, unbelievers in the New Testament church are sanctified by association with the body of Christ. They hear the preaching of the Word. They share in the work of the Holy Spirit. In these and many other ways, God has shown great benevolence to unbelievers in Old Testament Israel and in the New Testament church. 
Along with receiving great benevolence from God, unbelievers in Israel’s national covenants and in the new covenant owe God loyal service. They have received greater knowledge of God’s will. So, God has held them to higher standards of obedience. As Jesus put it in Luke 12:48:

> Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required (Luke 12:48).

Those who learn the truth of God’s Word, those who know his ways, are held accountable to what they have received. 
The Scriptures also indicate that unbelievers in Israel’s national covenants and in the new covenant experience the consequences of blessings and curses from God. As God determines, they receive different sorts of temporary blessings and temporary curses in this life. But unless they come to have saving faith in Christ, on the great day of judgment these blessings and curses will only lead to God’s eternal curses. They will remain under the judgment of God forever. In Hebrews 10:28-29, the writer of Hebrews wrote about the eternal judgment coming against unbelievers in the new covenant:

> Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy … How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? (Hebrews 10:28-29).

Notice here that these people are “sanctified” by “the blood of the covenant.” This does not mean that they had received eternal salvation. Rather, they were set apart from the world as participants in the new covenant. And when these people rebel against God — as they always do to some degree or another — there is only one expectation, namely, God’s eternal judgment, the judgment he has reserved for his enemies. 
We’ve considered unbelievers excluded and included in Israel’s national covenants and the new covenant. Now, let’s look at how true believers included in these covenants experience the dynamics of interaction with God.
