# Kingdom, Covenants & Canon of the Old Testament
### Lesson Four
### The Old Testament Canon
## INTRODUCTION

Everyone who has led a large group of people — a church or some other kind of organization — knows that it’s important to have an overarching goal for the group and to establish some basic policies. But as time passes, it’s often necessary to address specific opportunities and challenges as well. 
In the ancient world of the Bible, great kings had the goal of strengthening and expanding their kingdoms, and they established basic policies through international treaties. But these kings also addressed specific opportunities and challenges their kingdoms faced through a variety of royal communiques, some of which we actually have in museums today.
It was no surprise to ancient Israelites, then, that the God of Israel, the King of all creation, did much the same. His goal was to strengthen and expand his kingdom on earth, and he established the basic policies of his kingdom through covenants. But God also addressed specific opportunities and challenges that his kingdom faced through a variety of royal communiques, some of which we now have in the canon of the Old Testament. 
This is the fourth lesson in our series Kingdom, Covenants & Canon of the Old Testament. In this lesson, we’ll focus on “The Old Testament Canon.” The word “canon,” is an ancient Greek and Latin term meaning our “standard” or “measure.” And in this lesson, we’ll see how the Scriptures were written as God’s authoritative standard for his people throughout the ages. 
All Old Testament authors believed that God was spreading his kingdom from heaven to the ends of the earth. They also believed that God administered his kingdom through the basic policies he established in a series of major covenants. God made covenants in the days of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and in the new covenant that the prophets predicted would come in the future. Now, as far as we know, there were no Scriptures written when God made covenants in Adam, Noah and Abraham. But as Israel grew into a kingdom in the days of Moses and David, God applied the policies of his covenants to the lives of his people through the Scriptures of the Old Testament. These Scriptures were first designed to address ancient Israel, but they were also designed to be the canon or standard of faith and life for every generation of God’s people.
 We’ll reflect on the Old Testament canon in this lesson by exploring three major strategies that God’s people have used to apply his ancient royal Word to their lives. First, we’ll look at the Old Testament as a mirror that reflects on a variety of themes or topics. Second, we’ll examine the Old Testament as a window to history. And third, we’ll explore the Old Testament as a picture — as a series of literary portraits that emphasized certain outlooks for the people of God. These three strategies never stand apart from each other; they are highly interdependent. But for our purposes, we’ll explore them separately, beginning with how the Old Testament canon is like a mirror.

## CANON AS MIRROR

Have you ever noticed that when you read a book with a group of friends, some things grab your attention and other things capture the attention of others? The book itself may mention many different topics, but we all tend to give special attention to the things that matter most to us. This has always been true as God’s people have handled the Old Testament. Old Testament authors touched on many subjects as they applied the theology of God’s kingdom and the policies of God’s covenants to his people through their books. And as we approach the Old Testament, we can highlight any of these themes that are significant for our lives.

When we approach the Old Testament canon as if it were a mirror, we look primarily for what the Old Testament has to say about our concerns and our questions, even if those themes are only secondary or minor aspects of the Scriptures themselves. We call this strategy “thematic analysis” because we look for the ways the Old Testament reflects on themes or topics that are important to us as we seek to be faithful to God. 
To understand how the Old Testament canon often serves as a mirror in thematic analysis, we’ll touch on two issues: first, the basis or justification for this strategy; and second, the focus of this strategy. Let’s look first at the basis of thematic analysis. 

#### BASIS

Whether we realize it or not, when we read the Old Testament, it’s impossible to divorce ourselves entirely from priorities that rise out of our experiences. We look to the Old Testament as God’s royal word to his people. So, to one degree or another, we always go to these Scriptures hoping to find out how they address issues that are important to us. But this common practice raises a question: “Is this the right thing to do?” Is it right to read the Old Testament with our interest in mind?
There are at least two factors that serve as the basis for approaching the Old Testament as a mirror of our interests: first, the character of Scripture itself supports this approach; and second, many biblical examples affirm it. Consider first how the character of Scripture supports using thematic analysis. 

### Character of Scripture

Like most well-written books of any significant length, Old Testament books consist of many smaller elements that fit together into segments. These segments come together to form larger sections and these sections form entire books. Each of these levels makes its own contribution to what Old Testament books offer us. And we should feel perfectly free to focus our attention on any of these levels. 
Unfortunately, many well-meaning Christians often think of the meaning of Old Testament passages far too narrowly. They act as if every passage presents a very thin laser beam of instruction, and there is only one way to summarize it properly. But in truth, rather than being like a laser beam, the significance of biblical passages compares more closely to a gradually diffused beam of light. Some themes are quite important and passages shine brightly on them. These are the more prominent themes of biblical passages. And other topics, may be more “minor” themes that are addressed as if illumined by weaker levels of light. Thematic analysis recognizes this entire range of the significance of biblical passages and often draws attention to secondary or minor topics. In fact, minor topics usually become the primary objects of study in thematic analysis. 
To give a simple example of what we have in mind, let’s look at Genesis 1:1, the first verse of the Bible. There we read, “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” Now, if we were to ask ourselves, “What does this verse teach?” at first glance, we might think that the answer is very simple: Genesis 1:1 tells us that God created the world. Most of us would probably agree that this is a fair way to summarize the main idea of this verse. But, as true as this summary may be, if we restrict ourselves to this central topic, we ignore many other themes this verse touches. 
Just how many themes or motifs appear in these few words? Actually, the list is quite long. Besides speaking of the fact that God created the world, this verse touches on theological themes like “there is a God” and “God existed before creation.” It also tells us that God is powerful enough to create and that God should be acknowledged as the Creator. 
Genesis 1:1 also tells us about the creation itself. It tells us the fact that there was a creation event, a time when all things were made. It reveals that creation is not self-sufficient; it depends on God for its existence. And it explains that heaven is a dimension of creation and that the earth is a dimension of creation. This one verse touches on these and many more minor themes, and we can legitimately focus our attention on any of them. 
If so many topics appear in just one verse like Genesis 1:1, imagine how many appear in larger passages. Most Old Testament passages of significant length touch on many issues related to our interests and our experiences. Of course, we must be careful not to read our own ideas into the Scriptures. But if Old Testament passages explicitly or implicitly address issues, it’s quite appropriate for us to benefit from these themes. 
We can also see the basis for treating the Old Testament as a mirror in biblical examples of thematic analysis. Divinely-inspired biblical authors and authoritative characters in the Bible often drew attention to relatively minor aspects of Old Testament passages.

#### Biblical Examples

As just one striking example, consider Hebrews 11:32-34: 

> Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah … David and Samuel and the prophets … through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight (Hebrews 11:32-34).

Everyone familiar with the stories of Jephthah and Samson in the book of Judges knows that the book did not present these men in a consistently favorable light. In fact, the author of the book of Judges repeatedly drew attention to the moral failures of Israel’s leaders during this period of history, including Jephthah and Samson. He highlighted their failures to demonstrate that the judges were not capable of providing adequate leadership for the people of God. 
Still, the accounts of Jephthah and Samson in the book of Judges also report positive, but relatively minor facts about these two judges. Both of these men achieved victories over God’s enemies when they turned to God in faith. So, the writer of Hebrews drew upon the positive accomplishments of these men as he looked for examples of faith in the Old Testament. Even though he stressed these minor themes that were important to him, the writer of Hebrews remained faithful to the book of Judges. 

> New Testament writers can reference Old Testament relatively minor points of detail and draw from that points of application, as long as they’re faithful to the text. Jesus makes an astounding claim. He says that not a jot or a tittle of the word of God will pass away before the law of God is fulfilled. And one of the things that we can deduce from that is that every portion of the Scripture, from the major to the minor, is inspired of God, meaningful, and has value and purpose. And so, we actually see several examples of this in the New Testament — New Testament writers referring back to Old Testament events and teachings and drawing from them even minor points, points of application. The writer of Hebrews, in chapter 11, lists several Old Testament saints and draws from their particular experiences more general principles that apply to all believers everywhere in view of their broader hope of the gospel.

Now that we’ve seen the basis or justification for treating the Old Testament as a mirror, we should turn our attention to the focus of this strategy.
