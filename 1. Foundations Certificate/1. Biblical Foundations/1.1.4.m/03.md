#### Biblical Examples

Scripture contains many examples of biblical authors and authoritative biblical characters who affirmed the historical veracity of the Old Testament. In all of the Scriptures, there is not one instance of biblical writers questioning the historical reliability of the Old Testament. For example, consider the way the writer of Chronicles, in 1 Chronicles 1:1-4, relied on the historicity of the Old Testament in his genealogies. He began his genealogies in this way:

> Adam, Seth, Enosh; Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared; Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech; Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth (1 Chronicles 1:1-4). 

For modern Christians, the author of Chronicles did something remarkable here. He treated the first five chapters of Genesis as historically reliable by mentioning thirteen men from the opening chapters of Genesis. Most modern people consider these chapters to be legendary or fictional. But the Chronicler demonstrated his full trust in the historical reliability, even of the early chapters of Genesis. He used Genesis — as he went on to trust many other Old Testament books — as an authoritative window to history.
In a similar way, consider Luke’s record of Stephen’s speech in Acts 7. Using various portions of the Old Testament, Stephen spoke of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David and Solomon as historical figures. He affirmed that the stories about them recorded in the Old Testament were factual. As far as Stephen was concerned, the history reported in the Old Testament was true. And that historical record served as a basis for his theology as he called his fellow Jews to repentance and faith in Christ.

> The biblical writers are convinced of God’s work in history, and so from the earliest pages of the Old Testament — Deuteronomy 26, for example — we see that the worship of Israel is rooted in the actions of God. We’re told that the Israelites were to bring their offerings into worship and say this, that “My father [Abraham] was a wandering Aramean.” And so part of the worship of God’s people has always been historical rehearsal, to reenact, to remember — remember what God has done in history… We see this also with Paul. When he’s preaching in Pisidian Antioch in the synagogue there, he is talking about the work of God among the people of God. He starts with the exodus, he comes into the period of the judges, and he says God has raised up leaders, and he uses that theme of: God has raised up with his mighty arm the son of David, and has raised him up from the dead. So, God’s work in history and using the Scriptures to account for that and to depend on their account for that is something that every biblical writer does.
— Dr. Gregory R. Perry

Now that we’ve seen the basis for approaching the Old Testament canon as a window to history, we should turn our attention to a second issue: what is the focus of this interpretive strategy? What are the goals of historical analysis of Old Testament books?

### FOCUS

In general terms, handling the Old Testament as a window to history has the same goal as other approaches to the Scriptures. The faithful seek to know the will of their divine King. But historical analysis has a rather specific way of discovering what God has communicated to his people. The most basic form of historical analysis of the Old Testament is historical reconstruction — simply using the Old Testament, along with other evidences, to establish what actually happened in the past. But historical analysis has also taken a distinctively theological form as well. The Old Testament has been used as a window to history to discover the actions and words of God in the past and then to apply their theological significance to the lives of God’s people. 
In the last century, one popular form of theological historical analysis came to be known as “biblical theology.” The term “biblical theology” can refer to several different approaches to the Scriptures, but we’ll highlight one form of biblical theology that is widespread among evangelical Christians.
This prominent form of biblical theology generally focuses on two main steps: first, biblical theologians create what we may call a “synchronic snapshot” of historical periods, and second, they explore what we may call a “diachronic trace” through Old Testament history. These two steps are interconnected in countless ways. But for our purposes we’ll look at each of them separately, starting with creating a synchronic snapshot.

#### Synchronic Snapshot

The word “synchronic” refers to events happening within a set period of time. Biblical theologians create synchronic snapshots by focusing on a period of biblical history and then summarizing the complex networks of God’s acts and words that took place during that period. These summaries treat segments of time in biblical history as synchronized units or slices of time.

Now, we need to remember that Old Testament history flowed like a river. Its history was not divided into distinct segments. So, creating synchronic snapshots of Old Testament history is always somewhat artificial, much like dividing a flowing river into distinct segments is artificial. Still, it can be beneficial to speak of different segments of a river. And, in the same way, it can be beneficial to divide Old Testament history into periods of time and to summarize what God did and said during those periods. We can do this in many different ways.
You’ll recall that in our earlier lesson on the kingdom of God, we spoke in terms of the primeval history, the history of the nation of Israel and the future New Testament history. Noticing what God said and did during each of these periods helped us understand a number of things about God’s kingdom. 
But you’ll also recall that in our lesson on divine covenants, we divided biblical history into covenantal periods. We spoke of God’s universal covenants, God’s national covenants with Israel, and God’s future new covenant. And we went on to divide these three large epochs into smaller periods of time. The universal covenants included the age of God’s covenant with Adam — the covenant of foundations; and God’s covenant with Noah — the covenant of stability. Then we divided the period of national covenants into the times of Abraham — the covenant of Israel’s election or promise; Moses — the covenant of law; and David — the covenant of kingship. And we also segmented the period of the new covenant — the covenant of fulfillment — into its inauguration, continuation and consummation. These divisions helped us distinguish the basic kingdom policies that God established through different covenants. But these historical divisions are only two of many ways to create synchronic snapshots of Old Testament history.
![1.1.4.m.pic06.png](https://github.com/thirdmill/images/raw/main/1.1.4.m.pic06.png)
For instance, the seventh chapter of the Westminster Confession of Faith refers to the period of the “covenant of works” — the time before Adam sinned — and the “covenant of grace” that covers the rest of biblical history, including the New Testament. It also refers to an important division in the covenant of grace between the period that was “under the law,” meaning the time of the Old Testament, and the period that was “under the gospel,” meaning the New Testament.
In the last century, the widely respected biblical theologian Geerhardus Vos, of Princeton Theological Seminary, divided the Old Testament by using other criteria. Rather than focusing on covenants, he identified periods according to major shifts in the form and content of divine revelation. He spoke of the pre-redemptive era before the Fall; the first redemptive era following the Fall and preceding Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden; the period leading from the expulsion to the flood of Noah’s day; the period after the flood leading to the patriarchs; the period of the patriarchs; the period of Moses; and the prophetic period after Moses. And of course, as a Christian, he also added the period of the New Testament. 
Now, once a period of time is identified the job of the biblical theologian is to focus on the network of historical events that revealed God and his will during that period of time. Of course, in any historical period, all events that took place were interrelated. But the Scriptures highlight some events more than others. So, biblical theologians typically focus on these more formative or central events of biblical history.
For instance, when biblical theologians focus on the slice of Old Testament history often known as the “period of promise” — the time of Israel’s patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob — they often observe that God revealed himself in this time primarily through direct speech, visions and dreams. They also note that there was a narrowing of the ethnic focus to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They see that the patriarchs performed worship at many altars. They described the promise of many descendants given to the patriarchs. And they noticed the importance of the promise of land to the fathers. These kinds of observations are attempts to characterize the patriarchal period as a whole, identifying formative events that played major roles throughout that time frame.
Or, when biblical theologians choose to focus on the “period of law” — the time of Moses who led Israel through the exodus and toward the conquest of the Promised Land — they often focus on how God revealed himself primarily through the law of Moses. They also observe how the narrowed ethnic focus on Israel grew into a national focus. They describe how the tabernacle was constructed and worship was centralized there. They note that Israel had grown to large numbers. And they show how God led Israel to possess the Promised Land. These kinds of events characterized the period of Moses as a whole and give us a snapshot of this time in biblical history.

> Theologians often talk about dividing God’s plan into various eras and epochs… We have a number of examples in the New Testament of how the New Testament divides up the Old Testament. You think of Matthew’s genealogy. It begins with Abraham, works through David. It looks through Old Testament history in terms of Abraham to David, David to exile, exile to Christ. That’s a way that the Bible divides up Old Testament history… There’s other ways that the New Testament also divides it up. You think of Paul in Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15. You can speak of Adam and Christ; before the Law, after the Law. So, the New Testament shows a number of ways to do this.
— Dr. Stephen J. Wellum

With the results of synchronic snapshots in hand, biblical theologians usually move to a second step, what we may call a diachronic trace. 

#### Diachronic Trace

The term “diachronic” simply means “through time.” It refers to the ways something has developed or changed over time. So, a diachronic trace focuses on the ways God’s actions and words connect with each other through time, from one period to another. 
We can summarize the process of establishing a diachronic trace in this way: When we compare the formative events of various periods of biblical history with each other, we recognize that there are alignments or affinities between events in one period and events in another. Biblical theologians note these associations and explain how they reflect developments in Old Testament faith. 
One of the most difficult but rich features of interpreting the Old Testament is the fact that it doesn’t describe just one period of history. It touches on events over thousands of years. As we learn what God did and said over this long stretch of history, it’s obvious, even to a casual reader, that God’s revelations represent many kinds of theological developments. 
What God revealed in the time of Adam’s covenant was not simply repeated in the time of Noah’s covenant. God’s revelations in the period of Abraham’s covenant did not simply repeat what had been revealed earlier. And the same was true for the time of Moses’ covenant and David’s covenant. And divine revelation during the new covenant went beyond David’s covenant as well.
But divine revelations during these ages did not contradict each other. Revelations in later periods incorporated and built on earlier periods. The differences among different periods of time represent maturation or organic growth. Old Testament faith grew much like a seed grows into a sapling, then into a small tree, and then into a mature tree. Describing these developments in Old Testament history is the process that we call “diachronic tracing.” To illustrate what we mean, let’s consider just one facet of what God’s covenant with Abraham emphasized. We’ll look at God’s promise to give Abraham the land of Canaan. In Genesis 15:18 we read these words:

> On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates” (Genesis 15:18).

As this passage indicates, God promised Abraham the land of Canaan for his descendants. This event is central to any well-formed synchronic snapshot of the period of the patriarchs. 
But to understand the significance of this promise from God to Abraham in Old Testament history, we must explore other periods of time as well. We need to ask, “What earlier events form the background to this promise of the land of Canaan?” and “How do events afterwards serve to unfold the significance of this promise?” Consider first, the earliest period of biblical history, the primeval history, that included God’s covenants in Adam and Noah. As we saw in another lesson, during Adam’s time, God first established humanity as his royal priests and instructed them to have dominion over the entire earth. As we read in Genesis 1:28:

> And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth” (Genesis 1:28). 

At this time, humanity had not sinned, and dominion over the earth would have been relatively easy. But sin complicated the process of dominion by making humanity’s efforts difficult and painful. As God himself said to Adam in Genesis 3:17-19:

> Cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground (Genesis 3:17-19). 

Nevertheless, even after the fall into sin, God expected human beings to continue to strive for dominion over the earth. Even after humanity’s wickedness grew so great that God destroyed the world in Noah’s day, God maintained his command to spread his kingdom to the ends of the earth. As God instructed Noah in Genesis 9:1, immediately after the flood:

> Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth (Genesis 9:1).

Knowing this background helps us understand that God’s promise of land to Abraham was a step forward in the fulfillment of humanity’s call to have dominion. In the primeval times, God called his image to build his kingdom on earth by having dominion in a world of futility and sin. This dominion came to further expression when God called Abraham and his descendants to take possession of the promised land of Canaan. Now, this step of fulfillment in the patriarchal period was not an end in itself. The promise of a land to the patriarchs was a step toward an even greater fulfillment in the future. As God promised Abraham in Genesis 22:18:

> In your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed (Genesis 22:18).

This verse reminds us that God gave the Promised Land to Abraham and his descendants as a foothold. It was to be a beginning point from which they were to lead all families of the earth toward the blessings of redemption and God-honoring dominion over the entire earth — just as God originally ordained for humanity. 
For this reason, our diachronic trace of humanity’s dominion should move forward toward the period of God’s covenant in Moses. In this period, God established Israel in the Promised Land as the nation’s homeland, furthering the promise to the patriarchs by giving Israel the land in Joshua’s conquest. As God said to Joshua in Joshua 1:6: 

> Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them (Joshua 1:6). 

The original call for humanity to have dominion, and God’s promise of land to Abraham, were furthered when Israel took possession of the Promised Land. 
Israel’s initial possession of the land in the days of the exodus and conquest was also fulfilled further in the period of David’s covenant. This was the time when Israel secured the land against enemies and matured into a great empire. The security of the land provided by the house of David was a further step toward solidifying and expanding the initial conquest of the land. But the imperial realities early in this period also anticipated a day in the future, a day when the righteous rule of David’s house would reach dominion over the entire earth. This hope in David’s house is expressed in Psalm 72:8-17:

> May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth! … May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him! … May people be blessed in him, all nations call him blessed! (Psalm 72:8-17).

The hope during the period of David’s covenant was that David’s house would prove to be faithful to the Lord and that the kingdom would expand and bring redemption and dominion of the faithful over the entire earth.
Sadly, this great hope in the house of David collapsed during the time of exile and failed restoration. Rather than being a time of further fulfillment, it was actually a time of failure. This period became a terrible setback for the dominion of God’s people over the earth. God’s judgment came against his people, and he sent both the northern and southern kingdoms out of their land and into exile. 
And more than this, in his mercy, God brought back a number of Israelites to the land. He raised up Zerubbabel, the descendant of David, as the governor of his people and offered him great victory over the nations of the earth. As we read in Haggai 2:7-9:

> I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory … The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former … And in this place I will give peace (Haggai 2:7-9).

Had Israel been faithful, the blessing of redemption through the dominion of David’s house would have begun to spread throughout the world. But time and again the Israelites who returned to the land rebelled against God, so that the offers of blessing and expansion never materialized. In fact, the restoration was a miserable failure. 
It is at this point that Christian biblical theologians turn to the final stage of biblical history — the climax of history in the new covenant. The New Testament assures believers that God acted in Christ to reverse the failures of the exile and failed restoration and to bring fulfillment of redeemed humanity’s dominion over the earth. Jesus came to reverse the curse of the exile, to bring freedom and redemption from sin, so that those who follow him may rule over the earth with him. As Jesus himself said in Revelation 2:26:

> The one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations (Revelation 2:26).

> We need to go back and understand in church history and in history how God has been working, that even when God chose Abraham — 2000 B.C. — that God already had intended a blessing for the world. God, in choosing one man, is going to bless the whole world. So, he did that by working with Abraham, by creating a relationship with Abraham and establishing him, showing him what it was to receive grace totally unmerited, and then to work through him, through his family in a covenant relationship … so that, when Christ would come — this is not only for the Jews, that it’s not just for Abraham and for and his children, but for the whole earth to understand; this is the God of the whole earth — this is how he relates to people. And when Jesus came, he fulfilled all of those hopes and promises, and fulfilled so that even the New Testament says Abraham was awaiting that day, and Abraham is still awaiting the fullness of that, when he will be resurrected and all believers with him throughout the whole earth.

This brief example illustrates just one of the many ways diachronic traces of the biblical record of history give us insights into the Old Testament. Looking through the Old Testament to the history that it reports is a vital way to discern the significance of the Old Testament canon. 
Now that we’ve sketched how we can receive the Word of our King as we approach the Old Testament canon as a mirror and as a window, we should turn our attention to treating the Old Testament canon as a picture — as a collection of literary portraits.
