## CANON AS PICTURE
![1.1.4.m.pic07.png](https://github.com/thirdmill/images/raw/main/1.1.4.m.pic07.png)
Everyone familiar with the Old Testament knows that it doesn’t come to us as a list of themes or topics. Nor is it a straightforward record of historical events. Now as we’ve already said in this lesson, the Old Testament gives us authoritative insights into all kinds of themes, and it provides true records of history. But first and foremost, the Old Testament canon is a collection of literary works, a library of books, as it were. As we’re about to see, biblical authors wrote the content and structure of each of these biblical books to teach ancient Israelites to further God’s kingdom by submitting to the policies of God’s covenants in particular ways. And for this reason, God’s faithful people throughout the ages have gained many insights into the significance of Old Testament books by approaching them as pictures or literary portraits. 
In many respects, approaching the Old Testament canon in this way is like going to an art museum. If you’ve ever been to a museum or a display of visual art, then you know that it’s not unusual to hear an expert, or even a fellow onlooker, pointing out things like the artists’ use of light, color, line, form and texture. And they often go on to speak of how these artistic elements reveal what the artist was trying to “say.” Was the artist’s purpose religious? Was it political? Was the artist extoling some ideal? Exposing some evil or injustice? The list goes on and on. 
To answer these kinds of questions, art critics often take into account much more than what appears on the canvases of the paintings themselves. They ask, “Who were the artists?” “How did the artists’ experiences influence their art?” And they also ask, “For whom was the art created?” “How did the artists design their art to impact the beliefs, actions and emotions of others?” 
In much the same way, we can speak of approaching the books of the Old Testament as pictures. We not only take into account what appears on the pages of Old Testament books, but we also focus on the Old Testament authors’ lives and their attention to the needs of their original audiences. We call this strategy “literary analysis” because it focuses on how biblical writers designed their books to impact the beliefs, actions and emotions of the people of God for whom they first wrote.
To explore how Old Testament books may be treated as pictures through literary analysis, we’ll follow the same approach we’ve taken before. First, we’ll speak of the basis or justification for approaching the Old Testament in this way. Second, we’ll look into the focus of this strategy. Let’s look first at the basis for literary analysis. 

### BASIS

There are many ways to see the basis for literary analysis, but for our purposes we’ll limit ourselves once again to two factors: first, the character of Scripture itself; and second, examples of biblical authors and authoritative characters. Let’s consider first how the character of the Old Testament indicates the value of approaching Old Testament books as literary portraits. 

#### Character of Scripture

Literary analysis is based on at least three rather obvious features of the Old Testament canon. First, the canon comes to us in books or literary units. The Old Testament is a collection of relatively independent scrolls or books that were written to address the needs of ancient Israel over a period of 1000 years. A quick glance at the table of contents of a modern Bible reveals that it contains 39 books. Most students of the Bible are familiar with the traditional list of Old Testament books, but we should mention several features about these literary units. 
To begin with, we must not put too much stock in the names of Old Testament books because they were not original. Some titles come from older Jewish traditions, some come from the Septuagint — the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament — and some of the titles in our modern Bibles come from much later Christian traditions. 
We should also mention that 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles were originally just three books: Samuel, Kings and Chronicles. In a similar way, many interpreters have argued that Ezra and Nehemiah were also originally one book. As we read the Old Testament with a view to literary analysis we want to keep in view the units of the canon as they were originally given. 
And as we think about the Old Testament canon, it’s also important not to depend too much on the order or arrangement of its books. The order of Old Testament books has differed throughout history. 
As early as Josephus in the first century, Jewish communities have divided the Old Testament into three major sections: The Law, or Torah (תּוֹרָה) in Hebrew; the Prophets, or Nabi’im (נְבִאִים) in Hebrew; and the Writings, or Ketuvim כְּתוּבִים)) in Hebrew. This is why, for centuries, Jewish communities have referred to the Hebrew Bible as the Tanakh — “T” for the Law of Moses or the Pentateuch, “N” for the Prophets, and “K” for the Writings. The New Testament reflects this tradition in its own ways, sometimes referring to the entire Old Testament as “the Law and the Prophets” or as “the Law, the Prophets and the Psalms” — the first book in the Writings. 
But by and large, the Christian church has ordered the books of the Old Testament canon according to the Septuagint, the Greek Old Testament. Rather than following the order of the Tanakh, we usually speak of the Law — or the Pentateuch; the Historical Books — Joshua through Esther; the books of Poetry — Job through Song of Songs; and the Prophets — Isaiah through Malachi. 
These variations in the order of the books of the Old Testament canon reveal something very important for literary approaches to the Old Testament. The books of the Old Testament were originally relatively independent literary works. So, when we approach the Old Testament canon as a picture, we should concentrate, in the first place, on understanding each book as a unit. We look at the book of Genesis as the book of Genesis with its own distinct design and theological concerns; the book of Exodus as the book of Exodus, and so on. 

> The basic literary unit in the Bible for the most part — you might find certain exceptions like the book of Psalms or the Psalter — but for the most part, the basic literary unit of the Bible is the biblical book. Writers basically plan and write books. And that means, then, that context is not confined just to the passages that immediately precede and follow, which of course it is, and that’s very important, very important indeed. But really, it’s important to note how a passage functions, what role it plays within the whole book of which it is a part. 
— Dr. David R. Bauer

A second Old Testament characteristic that indicates the importance of literary analysis, is the fact that Old Testament books display sophisticated literary qualities. From common experience, we all know that some writings require more attention to their literary artistry than others. It would be strange, for instance, to find a shopping list written with the flare of a poem. A quick memo isn’t usually designed as intricately as an elaborate novel. When we come upon simple writings, we don’t usually need to pay much attention to their literary qualities. But when we read a sophisticated novel or poem, if we want to gain insights, we must give attention to the author’s literary techniques. 
As it turns out, archaeologists have discovered a wide range of written materials from other cultures in biblical times. We have letters, lists, receipts and the like that don’t exhibit much literary complexity. But we also have wonderfully complex literary works from the ancient Near East. The great cultures of biblical days had elaborate myths and legends, complex legal documents and intricate ritual texts. These were literary works that were designed with great care.
Without a doubt, the books of the Old Testament are among the most elaborate literary works that we know from the ancient world. By most standards, Old Testament books equal or surpass the artistry of the greatest literature of the greatest cultures of the ancient world. Understanding these sophisticated literary qualities of Old Testament books enables us to grasp how Old Testament authors sought to impact the lives of their audiences. 
A third reason we should pursue literary analysis of the Old Testament is because of its literary variety. The Old Testament canon isn’t a flat terrain with the same kind of writing on every page. Instead, it’s like a varied landscape of mountains, rivers, lakes, fertile plains, deserts and oceans. In other words, the books of the Old Testament represent a variety of genres or types of literature. 
Some Old Testament books are predominantly narrative, such as Genesis, Joshua, Judges and Ruth. These books also include brief genealogies, lists, poems, as well as worship and social instructions. Other books in the Old Testament canon are predominantly poetry, such as the Psalms, Job, and many of the prophets. Still other books are highly stylized prose, such as Ecclesiastes and Malachi. Beyond this, speeches characterize the book of Deuteronomy.
Realizing that Old Testament books were written in various genres is important because each genre had its own ways of impacting audiences. Law must be read as law; speeches must be read as speeches, stories as stories, poems as poems, proverbs as proverbs, visions as visions, prophecies as prophecies. To uncover how Old Testament books were originally designed to impact the lives of God’s people, we must take into account the genres that characterize each Old Testament book. This is yet another way that the character of Scripture itself reveals the importance of literary analysis. 

> It’s important to understand the genre of a biblical passage that someone is studying because it helps us to properly interpret. It helps us to ask good questions of the text. Genres — largely poetry, narrative, law sections; these big category genres — help us to understand what should we be expecting. It helps us to ask questions of the text. If it’s a poetic text we’re going to ask different questions than if it’s a narrative text. Poetry is often not trying to describe in detail the specifics of how a historical event came to pass. They’re often describing in much more figurative language; they use metaphors. So, you interpret these different types of genres in different ways. 
— Dr. Jim Jordan

In addition to the character of Scripture itself, literary analysis is also based on biblical examples, examples of biblical authors and authoritative characters who treated the Old Testament canon in this way. 


#### Biblical Examples

Every time biblical writers and characters approached the Old Testament in the light of the author’s purposes toward his audience, they employed a kind of literary analysis. For instance, Jesus focused on literary analysis as he dealt with what Moses wrote about divorce in Deuteronomy 24:1. In Mark 10:4, some Pharisees challenged Jesus’ view of divorce with these words: 

> Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away (Mark 10:4). 

In Jesus’ day, some Pharisees had interpreted Deuteronomy 24:1 as teaching that a man could divorce a woman for practically any reason, so long as he gave her a certificate of divorce. But Jesus corrected this false interpretation by reading this passage in the light of Moses’ purposes and the condition of his audience. In Mark 10:5, Jesus said:

> Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment (Mark 10:5). 

Jesus pointed out that Moses had permitted divorce as a concession to the Israelites’ hardened hearts. 
For our purposes here, it’s important to realize that Jesus refused to lift the text of Deuteronomy 24 out of its historical setting. He viewed the passage in the light of what he knew about Moses as the author and the ancient Israelites as his audience. The Pharisees had failed to account for Moses’ intentions toward his hardened audience. Jesus, however, knew the importance of these factors, and rightly concluded that Moses’ regulation was actually a concession to their sinfulness, not an ideal. 
Another example of literary analysis appears in Galatians 4:22-24. Listen to what Paul wrote about the Old Testament stories of Abraham’s wife Sarah and her son Isaac, and Sarah’s handmaiden Hagar and her son Ishmael:

> For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants (Galatians 4:22-24).

In verse 24, Paul said that the Genesis account of Abraham’s interactions with Sarah and Isaac and with Hagar and Ishmael “may be interpreted allegorically” because they represent “two covenants.” In other words, Paul understood that the account of Abraham’s interactions with Sarah and Hagar was written for a particular purpose for the original Israelite audience of Genesis. 
![1.1.4.m.pic08.png](https://github.com/thirdmill/images/raw/main/1.1.4.m.pic08.png)
The Genesis record made it clear that Abraham faced a choice of two ways of relating to God: the way of Sarah and Isaac on the one hand, and the way of Hagar and Ishmael on the other. On one side, Abraham was faithful to God when he relied on God to keep his promise of a child through Sarah. This path of relying on God and his promise was difficult, but it was the way to God’s blessing. On the other side, however, Abraham was unfaithful to God when he relied on his own efforts to have a child through Hagar, the Egyptian handmaiden. This path of relying on his own efforts resulted in God’s judgment against Abraham. 
As Moses wrote about the life of Abraham, he was keenly aware of the grand significance of Abraham’s choices for his Israelite audience. He told these stories in Genesis so that his Israelite readers would connect with two ways of life in their own day. On the one side, Moses wrote about Sarah and Hagar to call his original audience to rely on God to fulfill his promise of many descendants to possess the Promised Land. Relying on God and his promise was difficult, but it was the way of blessing. On the other side, Moses called the Israelites not to rely on human efforts by longing for Egypt, just like Abraham had turned to the Egyptian handmaiden Hagar. Turning back would result in God’s judgment against Israel. 
Following this emphasis on Moses’ original purpose, Paul applied these stories to the situation in the churches in Galatia. The Galatians were faced with a choice between the true gospel from Paul and a false gospel that had come to their churches from representatives of Jerusalem. The true gospel was that salvation comes by trusting in the promises of God in Christ. The false gospel turned people away from faith in the promises of God to human effort of obedience to the law as the way of salvation. 
As Paul said in Galatians, those who follow the true gospel of faith in God’s promises are children of Sarah and heirs of the promise. But those who follow the false gospel are children of Hagar and not heirs of the gift of salvation. Paul made it clear that the true gospel of faith in God’s promises leads to blessings, and the false gospel of obedience to the law leads only to judgment. It was Paul’s concern with literary analysis — his attention to the ways Moses designed his historical record for his original audience — that led him to apply Genesis in this way to the situation of the churches of Galatia. 
Now that we’ve seen some of the basis for treating the Old Testament canon as a picture, we should turn our attention to the focus of literary analysis. What are the main concerns of this strategy toward the Old Testament canon? 

### FOCUS

Evangelical Christians often refer to the proper way of interpreting the Scriptures as “grammatico-historical exegesis.” By this we mean that exegesis or interpretation should focus, in the first place, on the grammar or the design of the biblical text. But at the same time, exegesis must also be historical. And by this we mean that the grammar of a text must be viewed in the light of the historical settings of the author and the original audience of the passage. To one degree or another, these factors also come into view in responsible approaches to thematic and historical analyses. But they are especially crucial in literary analysis. 
To see the focus of literary analysis, we’ll look at three concerns. First, the writer; second, the original audience; and third, the document or text that we have in view. Let’s think first of the importance of considering the writers of the Old Testament canon. 


#### Writer

Christ’s followers understand that God inspired and superintended the writing of the entire Old Testament canon. But as we saw earlier in this series, this inspiration was organic. God used the backgrounds, thoughts, feelings, and intentions of his chosen human authors to create the books of the canon. So, we should also be concerned with this human side as we read the Old Testament. We’ll look at this facet of literary analysis in two ways. On the one hand, we should be aware of a number of dangers, and on the other hand, we should see a number of benefits of this approach to the Old Testament. 
In the first place, we face serious dangers when we speculate too much about the human writers of Old Testament books. In the past, many interpreters tended to focus on authors in ways that left them entangled in webs of psychological and sociological speculations. They did this, in part, by assuming too much about the precise identification of the writer, the specific circumstances he faced, and the details of his theological motivations. As important as these kinds of issues may be, if we go beyond what we know, we can make our interpretations depend too much on speculation. This kind of overemphasis on the writer may be dubbed the “intentional fallacy,” giving too much weight to our reconstructions of a writer’s intentions. 
But in the second place, a careful and responsible focus on biblical authors offers us many benefits. We may not know as much as we would like to know about them, but we can still grasp many things that will help us understand their writings. We can have varying degrees of general knowledge about their identities, about their circumstances, and about their basic theological motives.

> The information about the author of a biblical book is of great help to us as we try to understand its meaning. And this is because the Holy Spirit — in the way that only the sovereign God could — used human individuals in their personalities, in their background of experience, to deliver his inerrant Word. And often when we can get some sense of how he formed the human author to be the one through whom he would speak the Word, it enriches our understanding of the text. I think of … Psalm 51, a classic, the psalm of David’s repentance and of his recognizing his terrible sin against his faithful soldier Uriah with the taking of Bathsheba, and that confession. That whole psalm just comes alive as we see it as a confession of a king who is a man after God’s own heart and yet who has sinned grievously but finds forgiveness in God. 
— Dr. Dennis E. Johnson

To illustrate what we mean, let’s consider what we know about two important Old Testament authors: the author of 1 and 2 Kings and the author of 1 and 2 Chronicles. We don’t know precisely who these authors were. We don’t know their names or exactly when they wrote. We certainly don’t know much about their psychological tendencies. So, to rely heavily on these sorts of considerations as we interpret their books runs the risk of building our interpretations on little more than speculation.
At the same time, however, we can derive valuable information about both of these authors from the Old Testament itself. For example, we know that the author of Kings wrote during Israel’s exile in Babylon. The last scenes of 2 Kings 25:27-30 clearly indicate that the author wrote sometime after 562 B.C., after Jehoiachin had been released from prison in Babylon. But the author never mentioned the crucial edict of Cyrus in 538 B.C. that allowed the Jews to return to the Promised Land. So, the book of Kings almost certainly was completed before the release of Israel from captivity in Babylon. 
By contrast, the author of Chronicles — often called “the Chronicler” — wrote after Israel’s release from captivity. We know this because, among other things, the genealogies in 1 Chronicles 9 list those who returned to the land. Moreover, the Chronicler ended his book, in 2 Chronicles 36:22, 23, with the Cyrus edict.
We also know that both of these authors were among the educated elite of Israel. Both authors referred to information in the royal annals that would have been available only to the leaders of God’s people. And the author of Chronicles also referred to collections of prophetic oracles that are not contained in the Bible. 
Just knowing these few facts about the authors helps us understand the differences in their general theological motives. Various interpreters have rightly concluded that the author of Kings emphasized God’s justice in sending his people into exile. He also focused on the need for the Israelites to repent before they could return to the Promised Land. 
![1.1.4.m.pic09.png](https://github.com/thirdmill/images/raw/main/1.1.4.m.pic09.png)
By contrast, several interpreters have rightly concluded that the author of Chronicles emphasized the practical steps that the Israelites needed to follow after they returned to the Promised Land. And he focused on the blessings they would receive for obedience and curses for disobedience as they rebuilt their nation. 
There are a number of things we could say about these author’s beliefs and hopes, but the main point is this: we have sufficient knowledge about them to analyze the way they used literary techniques to influence their original readers. And we have even more information about other biblical writers, so that regularly focusing on the writer in our interpretations can be quite beneficial. 
Now in addition to focusing on the writer, responsible literary analysis of the Old Testament also considers the original audience. Who first received the Old Testament books? What was their situation? How were they to be influenced by these Scriptures? 


#### Audience

Just as there are dangers and benefits when we consider the writers of Old Testament books, we also need to be aware of the dangers and benefits of focusing on the original audiences. On the one hand, there are dangers when interpreters speculate too much about the audience. They imagine their precise identification. They reconstruct specific details of the audiences’ circumstances. They speculate about their psychological conditions. They go too far imagining their strengths and weaknesses. These kinds of overemphases on the audience may be called the “affective fallacy.” 

> The affective fallacy is where we take that psycho-emotional state of the reader and use it to exclude other considerations of a text. For instance, just because a psalm of lament written for the sake of people in exile is something we can identify with, it doesn’t mean that psalm doesn't speak to us when we’re not under those same psycho-emotional conditions. So that’s number one, is, the affective fallacy can lead us to believe or accept that Scriptures don't speak beyond those original circumstances. The other great risk is where we misidentify the psycho-emotional state with our own psycho-emotional state such that we’re reading things in or failing to read things that are in the text so that we’re essentially imposing our own personal situation on the text. And that’s a pretty common thing these days because, in terms of the text and the author and the audience, our day is dominated by reading texts in what’s called a “reader-centered” way. We have to let the author speak according to the author's intentions, and we have to let the words of the text itself, as well as the reader’s situation, go into the understanding of meaning. 
— Rev. Michael J. Glodo

At the same time, however, there are many benefits we can derive from considering the audience of Old Testament books. We know lots of helpful information. We often know their general location. And we frequently know some of the major events that they experienced. We also know that, as with most groups of people, some were faithful and others were unfaithful to their covenant responsibilities before God. 
In this light, let’s consider what we know about the original audiences of the books of Kings and Chronicles. We know, for instance, that the audience of Kings was still in exile. From the emphases of the book of Kings, at least some of the original recipients needed to be convinced that God was just in sending his people into exile. And we know that some of the audience needed to understand that repentance was required before Israel could return to the Promised Land. 
By contrast, the author of Chronicles wrote to an audience that had returned to the Promised Land. The books of Ezra, Nehemiah and Haggai make it clear that many among those who returned had failed to be loyal to God. And as a result, they needed to grow in their devotion to rebuilding God’s kingdom in Israel. Simply knowing these facts about the original audiences of Kings and Chronicles helps us understand much about the literary portraits of these books. 

> God revealed himself to an original audience, people in a particular place, in a particular time. This is one of the remarkable things about the Bible. It is not merely a collection of prescriptions from on high. God was speaking to particular people in a particular setting, and so when we know how they understood what they were hearing from God, what they were receiving from God, that helps us to know what the limits are for our own understanding. If I’m understanding the Bible in some way very different from what the original hearers understood it, there’s something wrong. Surely, my own context will make a difference, but my own context has to be understood in light of their context, and then I’ll know what the probable limits of interpretation can be. 
— Dr. John Oswalt

Now that we’ve touched on how literary analysis focuses on the writer and original audience, we should turn to the third and primary focus of a literary analysis of the Old Testament — the document itself.
