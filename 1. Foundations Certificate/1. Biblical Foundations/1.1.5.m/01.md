The Apostles’ Creed
Lesson One
The Articles of Faith

INTRODUCTION

Have you ever wondered what makes a tree a tree? Or a house a house? Or a person a person? Or to ask it another way, what qualities must something possess before we call it a tree or a house? These are complex questions that philosophers have been pondering for thousands of years. And we face a similar question when we approach the study of Christian theology. After all, there are countless churches that we would consider to be “Christian,” and many of them disagree about many things. So, it’s useful to ask, “What doctrines are fundamental and essential to Christian theology?”
Now, of course, as we ask this question, we need to be clear that individuals can be saved even if they have a very poor understanding of theology. Our commitment to Christ is sufficient to make us Christians. At the same time, it’s fair to say that there are several essential ideas that must be present in any theological system before it deserves to be called “Christian.” And since the early centuries of the church, the Apostles’ Creed has provided a useful summary of these core beliefs.
This is the first lesson in our series on The Apostles’ Creed, a well-known and widely used summary of what Christians believe. We have entitled this lesson “The Articles of Faith” because we will be looking at the Apostles’ Creed as a summary of the articles or doctrines that must be affirmed by all those who would call themselves “Christian.” The Apostles’ Creed appeared in various forms during the early centuries of the church. But it was standardized by about A.D. 700 in Latin. A popular modern English translation reads as follows:

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, And born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, died, and was buried; He descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven And is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, The holy catholic church, The communion of saints, The forgiveness of sins, The resurrection of the body, And the life everlasting. Amen. 
Our discussion of the Apostles’ Creed as the articles of faith will divide into three parts. First, we will speak of the history of the creed. Second, we will provide an overview of its statements. And third, we will focus on the importance of its doctrines for today. Let’s begin with the history behind the Apostles’ Creed.



HISTORY

As we survey the history of the Apostles’ Creed, we will focus on two matters. On the one hand, we will look at the development of the creed, considering things like its authorship and date of composition. And on the other hand, we will look at the purpose of the creed, the reason the church thought it was important to create and to use it. We’ll turn first to historical development of the Apostles’ Creed.


DEVELOPMENT

It was once believed and taught that the Apostles’ Creed was written in the first century by the twelve apostles themselves. It was even said that each apostle contributed one of the creed’s twelve distinct theological statements. However, there is virtually no evidence that this took place, or even that any apostles were directly involved in the writing of the creed. But if the apostles didn’t write the creed, who did? 

The question of who wrote the Apostles’ Creed is an open one because we do not have an author signed up for it. Almost certainly though these questions are questions that were asked of baptismal candidates going back perhaps as far back as 40 or 50 years after Christ. So, a person would be asked, do you believe in God the Father, maker of heaven and earth? And we know this because a number of people talking about their baptismal experience will refer to various of these questions. And by 200 A.D., Tertullius refers to what is called the Old Roman Creed which is almost identical to the Apostles’ Creed and he refers to it in terms of those baptismal questions, “Do you believe…?” “Do you believe…?” … The first reference to the Apostles’ Creed, per se, is by a man named Rufinus in 390 A.D., and he relates the story that each of the twelve apostles, including Matthias who replaced Judas, gave one of the affirmations in the creed. There really is no proof for that theory, but the idea that in fact, these affirmations go all the way back to the apostles certainly has good basis.

In the writings of early Christians, there are many lists of essential doctrines that resemble the Apostles’ Creed. On the one hand, there are rules of faith that catalog and explain fundamental beliefs in some detail. The writings of the early church fathers indicate that written rules of faith summarized the beliefs and practices of the churches that produced them. For example, Origen included a rule of faith in the beginning of his work, On First Principles, and Irenaeus included one in book 1, chapter 10 of his famous work Against Heresies. Rules of faith like these were intended to preserve the teachings of the church, and were used to train its people — especially its leaders. Often, these rules varied from congregation to congregation. Generally speaking, they included affirmations of important doctrines, as well as moral teachings and traditions. 
On the other hand, some ancient doctrinal lists are in the form of creeds. These were short lists that summarized the doctrinal portions of the church’s rule of faith, especially its most critical beliefs. These were often recited in liturgical settings, such as baptisms. In the first and second centuries, it may have been the case that each local congregation had its own creed, or way of summarizing essential biblical truth. But by the third or fourth century, some creeds were rising to greater prominence and being used in multiple churches. 
One ancient creed that rose to prominence in this manner was the creed from the church in Rome, often called the Roman Creed. This creed is so similar to the Apostles’ Creed that many scholars believe the Apostles’ Creed to be simply a later version of the Roman Creed. But regardless of its precise origins, what is beyond question is that the Apostles’ Creed eventually came into widespread use, especially in Western churches. In the early centuries, its precise wording varied somewhat from church to church. But in the eighth century the wording was generally standardized into the form that we recognize and use today.
With this understanding of the historical development of the creed in mind, we should look at the purpose behind the creation and use of the Apostles’ Creed.


PURPOSE

In our day, many Christians are suspicious of creeds, and it isn’t difficult to understand why. Although very few people would outspokenly claim that a creed has the same authority as Scripture, sometimes well-meaning Christians treat certain creeds if they were equal to the Bible itself. But no creed should ever be elevated to this level in theory or in practice. 
The Bible is our only inspired, infallible rule of faith and practice. Creeds, on the other hand, are fallible teaching tools that summarize our understanding of Scripture. And as we are about to see, the Apostles’ Creed was created to help Christians learn and remain true to the teachings of the Bible.
We will investigate the purpose of the Apostles’ Creed in three steps. First, we will look at Scripture as the original repository of true doctrine. Second, we will look at the churches’ traditional teachings as affirmations of Scripture. And third, we will see that the Apostles’ Creed was intended to summarize the churches’ traditional understandings of Scripture. Let’s begin with the fact that dedicated Christians have always affirmed that Scripture is the basis of our doctrine.

Scripture

Listen to the words of the early church father Origen in the Preface to his work On First Principles, written in the early third century:

All who believe … derive the knowledge which incites men to a good and happy life from no other source than from the very words and teachings of Christ. And by the words of Christ, we do not mean those only which He spoke when He became man … for before that time, Christ, the Word of God, was in Moses and the prophets… Moreover … after His ascension into heaven He spoke in His apostles.

Origen taught that Scripture in all its parts was the word of Christ, and that it was the source of all true doctrine. And listen to the words of the early third-century bishop Hippolytus, in section 9 of his work Against the Heresy of One Noetus:

There is, brethren, one God, the knowledge of whom we gain from the Holy Scriptures, and from no other source.

The early churches believed that the whole Bible was Christ’s word, given to believers by the apostles. In this regard, they affirmed the concept that theologians often call sola Scriptura or Scripture alone. This is the perspective that Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith, and the final arbiter in any theological controversy. 
We find a clear example of this in the writings of Basil, who was elected bishop of Caesarea in A.D. 370. Basil was a strong defender of the traditions or customs of the church, and often expressed his beliefs that these traditions could be traced back to the apostles. Nevertheless, when there was a question about the truthfulness of these traditions, he appealed to Scripture as the final authority. Listen to Basil’s words in his Letter 189, written to Eustathius the Physician:

Let God-inspired Scripture decide between us; and on whichever side be found doctrines in harmony with the word of God, in favor of that side will be cast the vote of truth.

Here Basil admitted that some churches affirmed one set of customary ideas in their rule of faith, while other churches had contradictory customs. So, he appealed to Scripture as the highest authority to settle the matter.
The early church relied strongly on Scripture as the basis for all its doctrine. But they still depended on the traditional teachings of the church to summarize and protect the teachings of Scripture.


Traditional Teachings

Now, it’s reasonable to wonder why the church felt it was necessary to preserve its traditional teachings. Wasn’t it enough simply to preserve the Bible, and to let the Bible speak for itself?

Well, there’s a need to formulate concise, clear statements on what the church believes, especially because there are false teachers who teach things that aren’t in line with what the apostles taught and what the Bible teaches. And so, especially in response to these false teachings, the church needed to formulate a clear summary statement on what it believed.

The church had the Scriptures as the basis of its faith, but of course, the Scriptures were very long and literacy was very limited. So, it was best for the church to summarize basic doctrines in one creed in order for people to understand and comprehend the faith without having to read the entire Bible. 

—	Dr. Riad Kassis, translation


The Apostles’ Creed was especially valuable, even necessary in early church history because the Canon of Scripture was not formally listed until around A.D. 397. So, what was the authoritative faith of the church? It was summarized in the Apostles’ Creed. But at that time, we had the Bible. So, why should we continue to have the creed? Because we can’t require people to understand the whole Bible before we accept them as Christians. The Apostles’ Creed still summarizes the essential teachings of the Bible in a simple way. And for this reason, it must continue to be used even now.

False teachers created many problems in the church. Some even denied central aspects of the gospel itself. In response to these circumstances, godly Christian leaders created short summaries of the central teachings of Scripture so that all Christians would know and affirm the basic content of the faith. Listen to the way Origen described the problem in another section of the Preface to his work On First Principles:

There are many who think they hold the opinions of Christ, and yet some of these think differently from their predecessors, yet as the teaching of the Church, transmitted in orderly succession from the apostles, and remaining in the Churches to the present day, is still preserved, that alone is to be accepted as truth which differs in no respect from ecclesiastical and apostolical tradition.

Notice what Origen said here. He did not say that the teaching of the church was infallible, or that it would always be perfect. Rather he said that the teaching of the church was to be accepted as true, as, or because it had been transmitted in orderly succession from the apostles and preserved until his own day. In other words, in Origen’s day, the teaching of the church was still an accurate summary of Christ’s words in Scripture. And for this reason, the church in his day was able to use it as a “standard” or “rule of faith” for testing doctrines. But the ultimate authority rested in the New Testament, not in the contemporary church.
We might illustrate this idea by thinking of a chain made of several links. The early church wanted to hold fast to the teachings of Christ, which could be found in Scripture. This makes Christ the first link. The apostles had direct contact with Christ, and were taught directly by him. So, their teachings are the second link in the chain. The apostles then preserved their knowledge of Christ in Scripture, making Scripture the third link in the chain. Each of these three links was perfect and infallible because it was superintended by the Holy Spirit.
 But the fourth link, the traditional teachings of the church, was different. The transmission of these customs was not infallible; the Holy Spirit did not guarantee that they would be kept free from error. In fact, as we have already seen, the customs of some churches were contradicted by the customs of others. 
Some of these teachings pertained to minor matters of practice — things that Scripture does not directly address. But other traditions summarized the original meaning of Scripture, especially with regard to major articles of faith, like those listed in the Apostles’ Creed. 
When it came to these central beliefs, the traditions had been confirmed by many church leaders in many places throughout the ages. Moreover, they could be verified by direct appeals to Scripture. This is why Origen felt confident in setting forth the church’s traditional teachings as a rule of faith.
Nevertheless, this link was not infallible. It was always possible for the churches, for its councils, and for individual Christians, to make mistakes. Listen to the words that Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage in the third century, wrote in his Epistle 73 against the doctrines held by Stephen, Bishop of Rome:

Nor ought custom, which had crept in among some, to prevent the truth from prevailing and conquering; for custom without truth is the antiquity of error.

Cyprian’s point was that some ancient Christian views and practices were not rooted in the truth handed to us from the apostles. Instead, they were “the antiquity of error” — errors that had crept into the church a long time ago. In fact, it was precisely this problem of human fallibility that made it important for the church to record its rule of faith in written form. Origen and other early church fathers wrote down the church’s rule of faith to make sure that Christians throughout the world would be able to compare their doctrines to the traditional ones. Church councils also recorded traditional teachings so that their judgments would inform Christians in different places and times.
In all cases, the goal of preserving the church’s traditional teachings was to ensure that the churches did not stray from the original meaning of Scripture, in order that believers would rightly understand the teachings of the apostles, in order that they would firmly grasp and live by the words of Christ.

The Bible is a very big book, and so you can’t, in one sense, just let it speak for itself. You need to give a good summary of it. Even within the New Testament there are major challenges to the doctrine of who Christ is. And you can see the apostles trying to argue and to say, “No, this is the truth.” And that issue continues into the second century A.D. Some major challenges to the doctrine of who Jesus is, and to the nature of the Bible. And so, they had to summarize the biblical faith as pithily, as shortly as they could do. And that gave rise to the Apostles’ Creed. The important thing to remember is they’re not actually trying to add to the Bible, they’re trying to elucidate and to draw out its meaning.

As Basil wrote in his work On the Holy Spirit in A.D. 374:

What our fathers said, the same say we … But we do not rest only on the fact that such is the tradition of the fathers; for they too followed the sense of Scripture.

Now, we should mention that in guarding its traditional teachings, the early church was not terribly worried about minor points of doctrine. They were focused on central, fundamental beliefs and practices. This is clear from the kinds of arguments they made in their writings, and from the kinds of things they listed in their written rules of faith.
For example, they wrote against Docetists, who denied the humanity of Christ. They wrote against Gnostics, who believed that the God of the Old Testament was evil, and who permitted all sorts of fleshly sins. And they wrote against many other false teachings that challenged the basic tenets of Scripture.
Having talked about Scripture and the church’s traditional teachings, we are ready to look at how the Apostles’ Creed summarized the church’s traditional teachings for individual believers.


Apostles’ Creed

As we have seen, the Apostles’ Creed was largely used to confirm that new Christians believed the fundamental teachings of the Bible. In much the same way that modern churches disciple new believers in classes and Bible studies, the early church used creeds to train new believers in the basics of the faith. 
Augustine, the famous Bishop of Hippo who lived from A.D. 354 to 430, summarized the value of creeds in a sermon to catechumens, new believers preparing for their baptisms. In this sermon, the creed he had directly in mind was the Nicene Creed, but his words accurately summarize the purpose and use of all sorts of creeds in the early centuries of the church. In A Sermon to the Catechumens: On the Creed, Augustine wrote this:

These words which you have heard are in the Divine Scriptures scattered up and down: but thence gathered and reduced into one, that the memory of slow persons might not be distressed; that every person may be able to say, able to hold, what he believes.

As Augustine indicated here, the central teachings of Christianity are scattered here and there in Scripture. So, the ancient churches summarized Scripture’s core doctrines in creeds. This ensured that every believer — even, as he put it, “slow” or uneducated persons — could affirm and hold fast to the fundamental teachings of Scripture.
Of course, since many congregations had different creeds, there was a sense in which they also had different minimum standards of belief. Some churches did not require sufficient understanding on the part of new believers, while others excluded believers who had true faith but lacked advanced theological knowledge. As a result, a person might qualify as a believer in some congregations but not in others. And in light of this disparity, the early church recognized the need for a creed that would be acceptable to every congregation that called itself Christian. 
The Apostles’ Creed rose to prominence in order to fill this need. It was a short, straightforward statement of beliefs that could and should be understood by all professing Christians.

The Apostles’ Creed is actually a narrative summary of the Christian’s faith. And it points out the fact that even though we believe that every single word of the Bible is the inerrant and infallible word of God, we are in need of a summary to help people understand what the essence of the gospel is. The Apostles’ Creed is just that kind of summary, emerging from so early in the Christian tradition, encapsulating what the apostles taught on the basis of Christ’s revelation to them concerning the essence of the faith. “I believe.” Everything flows from that. And so, what’s so important here is that the Apostles’ Creed helps us to say everything we have to say in order to say enough to communicate the gospel.

Now that we have spoken of the history of the Apostles’ Creed, we are ready to provide an overview of its affirmations. This big picture of what Christians believe can be just as useful today as it was in the early centuries of the church.
