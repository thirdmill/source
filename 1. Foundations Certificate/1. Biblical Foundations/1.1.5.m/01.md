# Kingdom and Covenant in the New Testament
### Lesson One
### Why Study New Testament Theology?

## INTRODUCTION

If you've ever seriously studied a work of art, a piece of literature, a play or a movie, then you know that there can be a big difference between enjoying it casually and analyzing it carefully. Detailed analysis can be a very consuming task, much different from just doing it when we want and how we want. But at the end of the day, you and I know that few things can replace the rich knowledge that comes from a meticulous
analysis of a subject or piece.
In many ways, this is the kind of experience followers of Christ often have when
it comes to the New Testament. We know the joy of reading these Scriptures here and there, now and then. But the insights we get from carefully studying the New Testament and its theology can really be a source of great fulfillment.
This is the first lesson in our series Kingdom and Covenant in the New Testament. In this series we'll follow a very traditional definition of theology and speak of New Testament theology as everything that the New Testament teaches about God himself and other topics in relation to God. We've entitled this first lesson "Why Study New Testament Theology?" In this lesson, we want to see why it's important to go beyond a casual familiarity with the New Testament and devote ourselves to the careful, in-depth study of New Testament theology.
In 2 Timothy 2:15, the apostle Paul referred to the fact that understanding New Testament theology often requires hard work. Listen to what Paul told Timothy:

> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth (2 Timothy 2:15).

Of course, many dimensions of New Testament theology are quite simple. But Paul made it clear that understanding Scripture is not always easy. Timothy was to be "a worker ... who correctly handles the word of truth." The Greek term translated "worker" is "ergates," a term that often referred to physical laborers. Paul's metaphor indicated that grasping the theology of the New Testament often requires hard labor. But if studying New Testament theology is so difficult, why should we do it?

> It’s really interesting that Paul, in his letter to Timothy, just in the space of a few words, says both that the Scriptures were given by the Spirit of God — they are “God-breathed” — but then just a few sentences later Paul says to Timothy, study, work hard to show yourself approved as a workman of God, studying and rightly handling the Scriptures. The Scriptures really reflect a covenantal relationship with God, God's gracious initiative to communicate with us but also our responsibility, our response to his Word. And because he has given his Word in language that we can understand — he’s accommodated himself to speak through human authors in using genre and language and forms that were familiar to the people and places of the time — we need to work hard in terms of learning that language, in terms of learning how genre works, how historical narrative works differently from poetry or differently from personal correspondence, because these different forms are used in the Scriptures. And just in terms of reading the Bible contextually, understanding how New Testament authors make use of the Old Testament in different ways that were common to the time in terms of how prior texts were used in a particular situation. So, Paul tells Timothy both, that the Scriptures are God-inspired from the Holy Spirit, but also that Timothy — and we, like Timothy — should work hard and should study to show ourselves approved and rightly handling the Scriptures.

 We'll explore why we should study New Testament theology in two ways. First, we'll examine the importance of understanding the New Testament's inspiration and authority. And second, we'll consider the challenge of dealing with the continuities and discontinuities between the days of the New Testament and our day. Let's look more closely at both of these issues, beginning with the New Testament's inspiration and authority.
 
## INSPIRATION & AUTHORITY

To investigate the inspiration and authority of the New Testament, we'll focus on the Bible's affirmations that the New Testament is both inspired and authoritative. And then, we'll offer a few clarifications for what we mean by "inspiration" and "authority." Let's begin with the biblical affirmations of these crucial Christian beliefs.
  
#### AFFIRMATIONS 
When followers of Christ reflect on the inspiration and authority of the New Testament, they almost always appeal to 2 Timothy 3:16 where the apostle Paul wrote:

> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16).

Here we find that Paul touched on the inspiration of the Scriptures when he said that "all Scripture is God-breathed," or as the Greek word "theopneustos" may be translated, "exhaled by God." He also referred to the authority of Scripture when he said that the Scriptures are "useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness." This is an important passage for understanding what followers of Christ believe about the New Testament. But now listen to 2 Timothy 3:15 where Paul told Timothy:

> From infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus (2 Timothy 3:15).

Strictly speaking, "the Holy Scriptures" that Paul had in mind here, and that Timothy had known "from infancy," were not the New Testament, but the Old Testament. So, why then do followers of Christ appeal to Paul's words about the Old Testament when they refer to the New Testament as being inspired and authoritative?
We'll look at three biblical affirmations that help us understand that the New Testament is inspired and authoritative. First, we'll explore Jesus' calling of twelve disciples. Second, we'll consider the foundational role of the apostles and prophets. And third, we'll affirm the inspiration and authority of the New Testament books themselves. Let's look first at how Jesus' calling of twelve disciples affirms the inspiration and authority of the New Testament.
#### Twelve Disciples
As Jesus began establishing a new remnant of God's people to fulfill God's purposes in Israel, he called out a special group of twelve disciples. The Gospels make it clear that Jesus set these twelve disciples apart from the others who followed him. And this distinction made them, with the exception of Judas, the ones whom he later sent into the world as his authoritative apostles.
In John 16:13 we read these words from Jesus to his twelve disciples:

> When he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come (John 16:13).

This passage indicates that there was much Jesus' disciples had to learn. So, "the Spirit of truth" would come and "guide [them] into all truth" about "what [was] yet to come." We see here that Jesus ordained his select disciples to teach the rest of his followers through the Holy Spirit. This and similar passages confirm our belief in the inspiration of the New Testament.
Now, the apostle Paul, who wrote much of the New Testament, was not one of the original twelve. But the Bible is clear that Paul was an authoritative apostle, and he met the requirements equal to those established for the twelve in Acts 1:21-22. This is one reason why Luke reported Paul's encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus three times: first in Acts 9:1-19, then in 22:6-11, and once more in 26:9-18. And Galatians 1:11–2:10 conveys that Paul spent three years with Christ in the desert of Arabia. This same passage also reports that the apostles in Jerusalem confirmed Paul's apostolic authority. As Paul put it in 1 Corinthians 15:8-9, after Jesus had appeared to more than 500 believers:

> [Jesus] appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God (1 Corinthians 15:8-9).

As an apostle, Paul called himself "one abnormally born" and "the least of the apostles." He was the only authoritative apostle who had not been with Jesus during his
 earthly ministry. But Paul was a witness to the resurrection of Jesus and approved as such by the original apostles in Jerusalem.
With the affirmations related to Jesus' calling of his twelve disciples in mind, we should also mention the inspiration and foundational authority of Christ's first century apostles and prophets.

#### Apostles and Prophets
Listen to the way Paul, in Ephesians 3:4-5, referred to the fact that not only he but all of Christ's apostles and prophets were the recipients of God's special revelation:

> My insight into the mystery of Christ ... has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets (Ephesians 3:4-5).

Here Paul referred to distinctively Christian teachings that had been kept secret, or a "mystery," until they were "revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets." It's not surprising, then, that in Ephesians 2:20-21 Paul also referred to the first century apostles and prophets in this way:

> [The church was] built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord (Ephesians 2:20-21).

 As this passage tells us, God is building the church into "a holy temple in the Lord," and Christ Jesus is "the chief cornerstone." But notice also that Paul identified "the apostles and prophets" as part of "the foundation" of the church. This indicates that God established the church of Christ on the authoritative teachings of the apostles and prophets. And as we saw in our earlier verse, the apostolic and prophetic teachings were authoritative because they were inspired by the Holy Spirit.
In addition to the Bible's affirmations of Jesus' twelve disciples and the foundational authority of Christ's apostles and prophets, we should also note that the apostles themselves considered the New Testament books equal to the Old Testament Scriptures. This point of view appears in a number of places in the New Testament, but we'll look at just two examples.
