#### New Testament Books

To begin, in 1 Timothy 5:18, Paul wrote:

> For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain," and "The worker deserves his wages" (1 Timothy 5:18). 

This verse may seem odd to us at first, but it's important for our discussion because Paul began with, "For the Scripture says." He then quoted two different passages. The first quotation, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," is a reference to Deuteronomy 25:4 in the Old Testament. But the second quotation, "The worker deserves his wages," is from Luke 10:7 in the New Testament. This correlation between Old and New Testament authority shows that the apostle Paul considered the writings of Christ's apostles and prophets equal to the Old Testament Scriptures. 
We see something similar in 2 Peter 3:15-16 where the apostle Peter stated:

> Paul … wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him… His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures (2 Peter 3:15-16).

In this passage, Peter acknowledged that Paul wrote "with the wisdom that God gave him." In other words, Paul's books bore the authority of God himself. But notice also how Peter pointed out that opponents of the Christian faith distorted Paul's letters "as they [did] the other Scriptures." In the larger context of Peter's epistles, the "other Scriptures" are the Scriptures of the Old Testament. So, we see here that Peter also treated the New Testament writings as having the same inspiration and authority as the Old Testament. 
The Bible affirms the New Testament as God's inspired and authoritative word for his church. Jesus himself promised that the Spirit would teach his apostles. And he established his apostles and prophets as the foundational authorities of his church. In addition, just as God's people received the Old Testament Scriptures as the inspired and authoritative Word of God, the church was called to receive the writings of Christ's apostles and prophets as inspired and authoritative.
Having seen how our belief in the inspiration and authority of the New Testament is supported by numerous affirmations in the Bible, we should now offer some clarifications for what we mean by these terms. 

### CLARIFICATIONS

Christians often misunderstand the terms "inspiration" and "authority" when it comes to the New Testament. So, as important as it is to affirm that these concepts are true, we also need to be sure that we understand them correctly. 
We'll look at clarifications for these two characteristics of the New Testament separately. First, we'll clarify what we mean by the inspiration of the New Testament, and then we'll consider the New Testament's authority. Let's first examine the New Testament's inspiration.

#### Inspiration

Throughout history, people claiming to be followers of Christ have had different understandings of what it means to say that the New Testament was inspired or "breathed out" by God. It helps to think of these points of view as falling along a continuum or spectrum.

On one extreme, some theologians hold a romantic view of inspiration. They believe that the Holy Spirit inspired biblical writers in the same way that secular poets or musicians might be moved to write. As a result, they think the New Testament consists only of the personal reflections and opinions of its human authors. They admit that these writers may have been wise, and may have had access to information that can be helpful to us. But they deny that the New Testament is a fully reliable record of what God wants us to believe, feel, and do.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, other theologians believe in what can be called mechanical inspiration. According to this outlook, biblical writers were relatively passive as they wrote Scripture. The Holy Spirit essentially dictated the Bible, and human writers passively recorded what he said. This view affirms the truth and authority of the New Testament, but denies that its human writers were an important part of the writing process.
Finally, most evangelical Christians believe in what has been called organic inspiration. This description indicates that it's impossible to separate the work of God's Spirit and the work of the human authors of Scripture. According to this view, the Holy Spirit moved human authors to write and supervised and directed their words. As a result, the words of Scripture are the words of God. At the same time, the Holy Spirit used the personalities, experiences, outlooks, and intentions of human authors as he guided their writing. So, the words of Scripture are also very much the words of its human authors. This third view best reflects Scripture's own testimony about the nature of inspiration.

> Now, by “organic inspiration” what we really mean is that Scripture hasn’t been dropped from heaven into our laps or that the writers were some kind of automatons… But men wrote as the Holy Spirit carried them along. And what we mean by that is that, although it is God's message, it is through the medium of actual people in real situations and real circumstances. Now, people may feel a little nervous about that. Maybe they want more of a direct connection between God and man. But the reality is, knowing that is much more helpful for us, because when I read Scripture, I know it’s God's message. And there’s dual nature to it. It’s God's message but it’s a human being who understands my experience, who is going through something similar to me with their personality coming to the text. And so, in reality, what we have is an inspired word that understands fully the human experience. It’s not dictated. It’s not some message that has no connection to the struggles of the human experience. And so, when we mean “organic inspiration,” that’s what we mean, that it came through actual personalities, in real situations. And so, when they write, they’re writing the message of God but with the knowledge and experience and passion of life lived.

For example, listen again to what the apostle Peter wrote in 2 Peter 3:15-16:

> Paul … wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him… His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures (2 Peter 3:15-16).

As we mentioned earlier, Peter acknowledged that God's Spirit inspired Paul's letters. But notice how Peter also indicated that this inspiration was organic. When Peter wrote, "His letters contain some things that are hard to understand," he acknowledged Paul's background, personality and writing style. This statement reflected Paul's high rabbinical education. And Paul's theological sophistication challenged Peter who was himself a relatively uneducated fisherman from Galilee. 
Peter's outlooks provide us with an example we should follow as we approach the theology of the New Testament. We must always keep in mind that the Bible's theological outlooks are God-breathed. They are true and reliable because they come from God himself. Yet, it's also important for us to put forth the effort required to learn about the human authors and their intentions as we explore the theology of the New Testament.
In fact, one of the most significant implications of organic inspiration is what it means to our study of New Testament theology. If we rely on a purely romantic or mechanical view of inspiration, we'll either disregard the authority of the text or ignore the author's contribution. But organic inspiration forces us to explore the theology of the New Testament on at least three levels. 
The main and most obvious level is that of the text itself. These explicit assertions can teach us a great deal about New Testament theology. 
On a level beneath the text, we have to be ready to explore the many implicit, or unwritten, theological presuppositions of New Testament authors. We have to study the authors' backgrounds and theological beliefs. And we should do our best to discover how their backgrounds and beliefs influenced what they wrote. 
On a third level, above the text, we also need to reflect on the authors' implicit purposes. In other words, what did biblical authors intend for their audiences? At times, New Testament authors were rather specific in the kinds of impacts they hoped to have on their audiences. But more often than not, they expected their audiences to infer the implications of their texts. 
Now, as you can imagine, keeping the explicit assertions, theological presuppositions and the implicit purposes in view as we explore the New Testament is not always easy. It often requires a great deal of careful study. But the nature of organic inspiration makes it necessary for us to explore all three levels of New Testament theology. 
We've just seen some clarifications for the organic inspiration of the New Testament. Now let's clarify what is meant by the authority of the New Testament Scriptures and how we should respond to that authority today.
