## CONTINUITIES & DISCONTINUITIES

Imagine that you picked up a book written 500 years ago. The language would be at least somewhat different from what you speak today. The concepts would be explained in ways that may seem a bit odd. The customs and traditions mentioned in the book would appear old fashioned. But at the same time, if you work at it, you might see how that book relates to your life today. Even a book written a long time ago wouldn't be entirely different from the world in which you live. It wouldn't be so foreign that you couldn't make some sense of it. It may take some effort, but eventually you could grasp much of what this ancient book says. 
This is what we face when we deal with the New Testament. It was written nearly 2,000 years ago. And for this reason, its language, concepts, customs and traditions are different from what we experience in our modern world. But at the same time, if we give ourselves to the study of these matters we can see that the New Testament still connects to our world in many ways. 

> The fact that the Bible was written 2,000 years ago is relevant and important because it was written in a culture at a particular time. But the fact that it's God's Word is what makes it relevant to us today, because God chose to speak by his grace and his mercy to us. And Hebrews tells us that the Word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword. And actually, that word is like as a little tiny surgical knife. And so, God's Word cuts us open and it stands above us as our authority, dictating and making demands of us, and making commands of what we should obey, and even telling us that we should love it, not just to obey it, but to actually love it and to memorize it. And so, it's important to us now because it's God's word.

To see how careful study can help us with the continuities and discontinuities between ourselves and the New Testament, we'll focus on three main considerations: epochal considerations, cultural considerations and personal considerations. These three subjects are interrelated, but it's still helpful to deal with them individually. Let's look first at some important epochal considerations. 

#### EPOCHAL 

When we speak of an epoch of biblical history we have in mind a period of time established by divine revelation that distinguishes it from other periods of time. Of course, there are many ways to divide history, and no period of time is completely distinct from what comes before and after it. Yet, we most often divide biblical history into the New Testament age and the ages of the Old Testament. We identify the New Testament period as the time of the new covenant. This epoch began with the first advent of Christ and will continue until his return. The new covenant age is unique in that it's messianic. It's the time when Jesus, the great Son of David, reigns on God's behalf. 
To understand why epochal considerations make studying New Testament theology necessary, we'll look at the epochal continuities that unify the new covenant age. And then, we'll deal with the epochal discontinuities that exist. Let's look first at the continuities. 

#### Continuities

There are many epochal continuities between our day and the days of the New Testament. One of the best ways to see these connections is to realize that Christians today serve the same God that Christ's followers did in the first century. Traditional systematic theologians often point out how the Scriptures teach that God is immutable, or unchangeable. They focus on his unalterable attributes, his eternal plan and his covenant oaths in passages like Numbers 23:19, Isaiah 46:10, and James 1:17. And because we serve the same immutable God, we should expect there to be many similarities in what God expected from his people in the New Testament and what he expects from us today. Listen to Hebrews 13:7-8:

> Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever (Hebrews 13:7-8).

Here the author of Hebrews insisted that his audience, "consider the outcome of their leaders' way of life and imitate their faith." He supported this exhortation by reminding them of the immutability of God when he said, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." His audience could be confident that if they imitated the faith of their leaders from the past, they would see similar outcomes in their own day because Jesus is immutable. 

Just like the original audiences of the New Testament, we live after Christ's death has made the final atonement for sin. We've been raised with Christ in his resurrection, just like first century believers. We live in the age when God's Spirit is poured out far beyond what had occurred in the Old Testament. We're part of the same body of Christ with the same mission of spreading everything Jesus taught to the ends of the earth. Despite the historical distance that separates us from the days of the New Testament, the immutable Creator has established these kinds of epochal continuities so that we can apply the New Testament to our day. 
Now, that we've looked at some epochal considerations and the continuities that exist between our day and New Testament times, let's view some discontinuities within the new covenant epoch that require us to devote ourselves to careful study of New Testament theology.
