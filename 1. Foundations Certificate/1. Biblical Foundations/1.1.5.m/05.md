UNIVERSAL

One way that we judge the truth of facts is by looking at what different witnesses have to say. The more witnesses that point to the truth of an idea, the more likely we are to believe it. Well, the same thing is true in theology. As we try to determine what we should believe, it helps to know what other people throughout history have believed, as well as what people in the modern world believe. And when it comes to the Apostles’ Creed, its doctrinal statements have always been affirmed by most Christians in most places.
We will explore the universal nature of the articles of faith in the Apostles’ Creed in three historical periods. First, we will see that these beliefs are grounded in the New Testament. Second, we will see that they have been affirmed by most Christians throughout church history. And third, we will look at the ways they continue to characterize the church in the present. Let’s begin with the New Testament, and its consistent affirmation of these doctrines.


New Testament

From the earliest days of the church, there have been disagreements over the teaching of Christ and of the apostles. Some of these disagreements have arisen outside the church, while others have come from within the church. For instance, Paul frequently wrote against the Jewish Christians who demanded that Gentile converts be circumcised, as in Galatians 5. And in 2 Peter 2, Peter warned that there would be false teachers in the church. The New Testament is full of examples of Jesus and the apostles correcting the mistaken ideas of various people. 
And errors in the church are dangerous when critical beliefs are at stake. This is why Jesus and the authors of the New Testament were so concerned to correct errors on fundamental points of theology. And the remarkable thing is that as they offered their corrections, they agreed entirely with each other. Despite the many false teachings that existed in the church at this time, the New Testament exhibits unfailing doctrinal unity with itself. 

The fact that the church established a canon made up of these books — which by the way took the church centuries actually to do, so it wasn’t just a quick process — indicates that the considered judgment of the church is that there is a core of unity here. That’s not a consideration that we can easily pass off, and as a matter of fact, that has been the judgment of scholars within the church over the last 2000 years. And yet, while we can talk about a core of unity between the New Testament documents, you do have to acknowledge that there are differences in perspective between them. I think the operative issue is that the differences of perspectives do not actually come down to a contradiction of doctrinal assertions. You get different perspectives, different emphasis, different ways of talking about the reality, different aspects of the reality. But, in my judgment at least, there is no blatant contradiction between the various books of the New Testament.

In light of this unity, when the New Testament affirms the articles of faith listed in the Apostles’ Creed, it is fair to say that it does so universally. It consistently argues for the divinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, while at the same time insisting that there is only one God. The Gospels present the creedal facts of Christ’s conception, birth, life, ministry, death, resurrection and ascension. And the books of the New Testament entirely support the creed’s statements about the church and salvation.
Having looked at the New Testament, let’s see how these beliefs have universally characterized Christianity throughout church history.

Church History
	
Just like the church in the New Testament, the church of later centuries exhibited a variety of theologies. On many minor issues, there was very little unity. But the more central doctrines, such as the articles of faith in the Apostles’ Creed, were received and affirmed almost universally. And in those cases where these fundamental beliefs were rejected, the church and history have largely counted the dissenters as schismatics and false teachers.
As just one example, consider the events of the fourth century A.D. The earliest versions of the Apostles’ Creed were already in use at this time. At this point in history, several heresies arose that the church dealt with in its councils. Some of these were local councils, but others were considered to be ecumenical because they included bishops from most parts of the church throughout the world. For instance, the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325 and the Council of Constantinople in A.D. 381 were ecumenical councils dealing with issues related to several of the articles of faith in the Apostles’ Creed. 
The modern Nicene Creed was initially drafted at the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325, and it reached its modern form at the Council of Constantinople in A.D. 381. It is largely an expansion and explanation of the Apostles’ Creed, intended to clarify several of its ideas for the sake of denying false interpretations of the creed. 
For instance, the heresy known as Gnosticism taught that the God of the Bible that created the world had himself been created by another god. Heresies like Gnosticism were not explicitly condemned by the Apostles’ Creed, so the Nicene Creed added language to make the intent of the Apostles’ Creed clearer.
Specifically, where the Apostles’ Creed merely said “I believe in God the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth,” the Nicene Creed offered this expanded statement: We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. Notice four things here: 
First, the Nicene Creed is based on the Apostles’ Creed. By basing their own creed on the Apostles’ Creed, the ecumenical Nicene Council demonstrated that the church universally affirmed the Apostles’ Creed. 
Second, the Nicene Creed began with the word “we” in place of the word “I.” Whereas the Apostles’ Creed had been intended as an individual’s profession of faith at baptism, the Nicene Creed was a statement that the church universally and collectively endorsed these same doctrines. 
Third, the Nicene Creed offered a clarification by adding the word “one” before the word “God.” This made explicit what the Apostles’ Creed had implied: that there is only one God.
And fourth, the Nicene Creed offered the clarification that God created everything, including invisible things such as spirits. This made it clear that God himself was not created. Again, this point was implicit in the Apostles’ Creed, so that the Nicene Creed was simply clarifying the matter.
These types of affirmations and clarifications continued to be offered by other councils and theologians throughout the centuries. At times, the decisions of councils were not accepted by all churches. One council would condemn the views of some churches; another council would condemn the views of other churches. But in most cases, the churches on both sides of these controversies continued to affirm the basic principles of the Apostles’ Creed. 
For this reason, the Apostles’ Creed has commonly been viewed as the most basic and most ecumenical statement of the Christian faith. Only the Nicene Creed has approached the Apostles’ Creed in terms of ecumenical acceptance throughout history. But the Nicene Creed is not nearly as basic. It includes several theological statements that even theologians often misunderstand. This is why we have chosen the Apostles’ Creed as the foundation for this study of the central tenets of the Christian faith.
So far, we have indicated the New Testament’s universal agreement with the Apostles’ Creed, and mentioned the acceptance of its doctrines throughout church history. Now we are ready to speak of the present, noting that these same beliefs still characterize the Christian church.


Present

In every age, false teachers have denied basic beliefs that the church has held for centuries. In the modern world, cults such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Mormons consider themselves to be Christians because they accept the Bible and attempt to follow Christ in some manner. But they are not truly Christian because they deny basic beliefs that have defined the boundaries of Christianity for two thousand years — beliefs that can be found in the articles of faith in the Apostles’ Creed. Even some churches that are not recognized as cults deny similarly basic teachings, as do certain individual teachers within Christian churches.
But if so many people reject doctrines listed in the Apostles’ Creed, how can we say that the creed universally characterizes the church today? Well, the answer is twofold. For one thing, the vast majority of churches that claim to be Christian affirm these doctrines. They are taught and believed by conservative Protestants of all types, including Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and so on. They are also affirmed by larger non-Protestant churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the churches of Eastern Orthodoxy. 
Besides this, churches that deny these doctrines probably shouldn’t be called “Christian.” While they may endorse the Bible and claim to follow Christ, they do not actually embrace the teachings of Scripture or of the historic church. And because of this, they are not genuinely Christian. 

Well when you think about the importance of the doctrines that are expressed in the Apostles’ Creed for instance, these things are utterly essential to the life of the church and our understanding of the nature of the gospel and our understanding of our own salvation in Christ. For instance, the creeds announce to us the Triune nature of God: God is Father, God is Son, and God is Holy Spirit. So, if we’re going to be Christian, we can’t pretend as though the doctrine of the Trinity is some nice little extra coating on our faith, as though it gives it an extra little “zing” of some kind. Instead the doctrine of the Trinity is a statement about who our God, in his essence, truly is.

I would say the doctrines in the Apostles’ Creed are essential and basic to Christianity. And indeed, if you veer away from them, you’re departing from the historic Christian faith. That’s the experience of the early church, they discovered there were all kinds of different ways in which the Bible could be interpreted and they said, “this is the correct way.” It’s like a railway track: “This is the correct groove in which to interpret the Bible.” Go this way and you’re departing from the essential Christian faith. And so, to this day the Apostles’ Creed, I think, defines the essential nature of authentic Biblical faith.

Because the beliefs summarized in the Apostles’ Creed are so foundational and universal, they exert a unifying influence among believers. This is particularly valuable today because there is so much division in the modern church.
