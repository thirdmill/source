Discontinuities

To be sure, the epochal discontinuities between New Testament days and our day are not as substantial as the epochal discontinuities between the Old Testament and our day. Yet, there are some significant differences that we must keep in mind whenever we study the New Testament. In Ephesians 2:20, the apostle Paul referred to one of the most substantial epochal discontinuities when he said: 

[The church was] built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20).

Here, Paul made a distinction between the church's foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself, and the church throughout history. 
As we said earlier in this lesson, for nearly 2,000 years the church has recognized the foundational authority that Christ and his apostles and prophets have over us. But we must also realize that they are no longer physically present with us. This reality creates a number of discontinuities between New Testament times and our lives today. 
First, the New Testament contains many examples of authenticating miracles performed by Jesus and his apostles and prophets. The ability to perform such miracles set Jesus and his apostles apart as authorities and foundational leaders of the church. God continues to work supernaturally in the church today, but we don't look for miracles as a way of discerning the authority of new church leaders. Instead, authority in the church today is established by the standard of the New Testament. And for this reason, we must be sure to study very carefully how this standard applies to our day. 
Second, in New Testament times it was possible to make direct appeals to Jesus' apostles and prophets. Christians could appeal to the apostles and prophets for guidance and answers to questions. We see this, for example, in the ways Paul responded to the appeals of Christ's followers in books like 1 and 2 Corinthians and Philemon. Moreover, in New Testament days, church-wide issues could be decided by the interactions of the church's foundational leaders, as in the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15. But in our day, we don't have these foundational authorities living among us. So, we have to lean on our study of the New Testament and consider how it applies in our day. 
Third, as we study New Testament theology we often have to face the fact that New Testament authors had theological emphases that were particularly important for the foundational period of the church, but that may not concern us today. 
The New Testament was written during the time when God's people were transitioning between Old and New Testament faith. For this reason, many of the issues addressed in the New Testament deal with how followers of Christ were to relate to Old Testament practices and Jewish traditions. Did Christian men need to be circumcised? Did they have to observe Jewish dietary laws? How were Christians to understand the continuation of animal sacrifices at the temple after Christ's final atonement? How were Jewish ceremonies and festivals to be incorporated into the life of the church? Of course, many of these foundational theological issues were settled long ago. And once the foundational period of the new covenant ended, the Christian church moved on to other challenges. 
When we read the New Testament, it can be difficult to overcome the epochal discontinuities. But, if we want to apply the New Testament's answers to these ancient theological controversies today, we often must work hard and study these texts very carefully. 

When one reads the Bible, one has to always put it in its original context. When we do that, sometimes we don't realize some of the issues that they're struggling with because they're so unlike the issues that we wrestle with today. So, for example, in the Old Testament, all of the covenantal issues that are tied to Israel — living under the old covenant, and then as you have the coming of Christ, the fulfillment of that — are main theological issues that the church has to wrestle with. What's the relationship of old covenant demands? How is it brought to fulfillment in the church? What's the relationship between Jew and Gentile? And even in saying it like that, we don't often think in those kind of categories so that we have to do a good job first of going back to the Scripture, understanding it on its own terms, in its own context, in its own presentation, understanding how the covenants work, how they're brought to fulfillment in Christ, and then begin to think through how does this now apply to us.

Having looked at the continuities and discontinuities within epochal considerations, we should now explore a few cultural considerations. 


CULTURAL 

When we speak of culture, we have in mind the patterns of human communities that develop out of shared concepts, behaviors and emotions. Culture is expressed in things like art, fashion, technology, political structures, and other conventions of daily human interaction. And when we deal with New Testament theology, we have to give attention to these cultural dimensions of life in both the first century and in our own day. 
Whenever we pay attention to cultural considerations, we have to look at both cultural continuities and also discontinuities. At times, this is not an easy task. So, we have to be ready to devote ourselves to careful reflection. Let's see how this is true first with cultural continuities. 

Continuities

We all know that every culture is different, and those differences grow larger with temporal and geographical distance. But as much as we recognize these differences, every human culture exists in the same world. This fact creates many cultural continuities even across time and geography. Every culture on earth is shaped by the nature of human beings and the physical, natural environment. And in so far as these factors are similar, the patterns of culture are similar as well. As Ecclesiastes 1:9 puts it: 

What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun (Ecclesiastes 1:9).

In this light, it shouldn't surprise us that when we look beneath superficial differences, we find many similar features of culture between our times and New Testament times. We still wear clothes, enjoy art, have families, establish governments, and punish crimes, much like people did in New Testament times. For this reason, it's often very easy to see similarities between cultures in the first century and our own day. 
Take for instance, the scene in John 4:6-7 that introduces Jesus' conversation with a Samaritan woman.

It was about the sixth hour. When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?" (John 4:6-7). 

Many of us have heard explanations of the cultural dimensions of this scene. Jesus met and talked with a Samaritan woman, even though Jews in Jesus' day considered Samaritans "unclean" and refused to associate with them.
Now, as modern readers we don't have feelings one way or the other about Samaritans. And we don't even think about whether or not people are ceremonially clean. But still, it isn't difficult to see significant parallels between this biblical scene and social prejudices in our own day. Unfortunately, people today are not very different from people in the first century in this regard. And because we live in the same world as people in the days of the New Testament, we're often able to draw parallels to our modern cultural experiences with ease, despite the differences.
While it's important to realize that cultural considerations include cultural continuities between ourselves and the New Testament, we must also be aware of the impact of cultural discontinuities on our understanding of New Testament theology.
