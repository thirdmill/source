The Apostles’ Creed
Lesson Two
God the Father
INTRODUCTION

Many religions worship a being they refer to as “God.” And this brings up an interesting question: Are they all worshiping the same being, just by different names? Or are they worshipping different gods altogether? Well, the Bible explains that although many different religions use the same word — “God” — they mean very different things by it. Scripture insists that there is only one true God — the one worshiped by Christians. And that means that the gods of the other religions are imposters, idols, false gods. This is why Christianity has always placed such a strong emphasis on knowing the God of the Bible. He is the only true God, the only one who has the power to create, to destroy, and to save.
This is the second lesson in our series The Apostles’ Creed, and we have entitled it “God the Father.” In this lesson, we will focus on the first article of faith in the Apostles’ Creed — the article that affirms belief in God the Father, the first person of the Trinity.
As we saw in a prior lesson, the Apostles’ Creed appeared in various forms during the early centuries of the church. But it was standardized by about A.D. 700 in Latin. A popular modern English translation reads as follows:

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, And born of the virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, died, and was buried; He descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven And is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, The holy catholic church, The communion of saints, The forgiveness of sins, The resurrection of the body, And the life everlasting. Amen. 
You will recall that in these lessons we have divided the Apostles’ Creed into five main sections: The first three sections deal with the three persons of God: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. These are followed by a section on the church, and then a section on salvation. In this lesson, we will focus on the first of these five sections, which consists of only one article of faith:

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. 
There are many ways we might divide the topics mentioned in this article of faith. But in this lesson, we will focus on three themes that have been central to Christian theology: the idea of God, the person of the Father Almighty, and his role as the Maker of all creation.
Following these three themes, our lesson on God the Father will divide into three parts. First, we will address the basic idea of God, looking at some general things the Bible teaches about his existence and nature. Second, we will focus on the phrase “Father Almighty,” paying attention to some distinctive qualities of the first person of the Trinity. And third, we will explore the Father’s role as the Maker, or creator, of everything that exists. Let’s begin with the concept of God that the Bible presents to us.



GOD

Our belief in God is really fundamental to our belief about everything else. And so, if you think in terms of the worldview, God is at the center, and everything else is as it is because of its relation to him. And that puts God-centered thinking on a different wavelength altogether from the way of thinking that’s usual in our culture, which is self-centered, me-centered, and then concerned with how everything else, including God himself, relates to me. And that is utterly contrary to the Bible way of looking at things, I think, I dare say, utterly contrary to God’s own way of looking at things, as Scripture reveals it. So, in ministry today, it’s very important to challenge me-centeredness, which is so natural to us, and to try and put God-centeredness and a God-centered worldview in place of the me-centered perspective.

We will consider the basic idea of God as he is presented in Scripture by looking at two subjects. On the one hand, we will explore what theologians often call “the singularity of God,” the fact that he is the only God that exists. And on the other hand, we will focus on the simplicity of God, noting that he really is only one God, despite the fact that he has three persons. Let’s begin with God’s singularity, the doctrine that the God of the Bible is the one and only true God.



SINGULARITY

As we explore God’s singularity, we will look first at the polytheism that was prevalent in the world during the early centuries of the church. Second, we will explore monotheism as the affirmation of a single god. And third, we will speak of Christianity and its conception of God. Let’s turn first to the topic of polytheism.


Polytheism

Polytheism is belief in the existence of multiple gods — powerful supernatural beings that control the universe. Some such gods are thought to be eternal, uncreated beings, while others are thought to have been born or even created in some fashion. In polytheistic systems, the gods are often distinct from one another, and therefore unique in some sense, just as individual human beings are all unique. But in polytheism, no one god can claim to be the only supernatural being who exercises significant control over the universe.
One popular type of polytheism, known as henotheism, expressed primary dedication to one god without denying the existence of other gods. For example, some people in the Roman Empire honored Zeus as supreme while still acknowledging other gods.
In the world of the early church, most non-Christians were polytheists. Many believed in the false gods of the Greeks and Romans, while others worshipped the idols of the ancient Near East. There were also polytheists who believed in cosmic powers, and some who worshipped the elements or other aspects of creation. Atheism — the belief that no gods exist — was rare.
One reason that belief in various gods was so common was that polytheism was often required by law. For example, in the Roman Empire, the government enforced the worship of the Roman gods. The Romans required this worship in order to gain the gods’ favor and protection for the Empire. But a more basic reason for the belief in various gods was the sinfulness of human beings. 

 The Bible indicates that humans are very prone to turn away from the true God to false gods. This has to do especially with the Bible’s doctrine of sin. It doesn’t have to do as much with the fact that we are creatures in relation to the great creator but rather that we are sinful creatures in relation to God. Sin acts in such a way as to actually blind us even with regard to the truth of God as God has revealed it to us in creation. And so, left to ourselves we will in fact identify as God or identify as divine qualities those things that are not true of God at all. In other words, we will create gods of our own imagination as substitutes for the true God. 

—	Dr. David R. Bauer

As Scripture teaches, all people know deep down in their hearts that the universe could not possibly have come about without the hand of a divine creator. But in our sin, human beings do not naturally acknowledge the true God and credit him for these things. Instead, we attribute his work to other sources. Listen to the way Paul talked about this in Romans 1:20-23:

Since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities — his eternal power and divine nature — have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened... [They] exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles (Romans 1:20-23).

According to Paul, the existence of the God of Scripture is obvious to everyone — it is clearly seen and understood. Paul even went so far as to say that human beings knew God through his self-revelation in creation. But we are so sinful that we refused to glorify him or to give him thanks. Instead, we exchanged his glory for false gods that we invented and worshiped in his place.

The Bible tells us that all men and women and children know God deep down in their hearts, in their minds, and in their consciences. But Romans 1 tells us that ever since Adam and Eve sinned, that we have turned in the depths of our hearts from worshiping the true God to worshiping idols or anything that’s created by God. And so, the human heart is practically a factory, a source, the root of all kinds of idols. 

—	Dr. Samuel Ling

With this picture of polytheism in mind, we are ready to explore monotheism, the belief that only one god exists.


Monotheism
	
Technically speaking, monotheism can refer to any religion that affirms belief in only one god. For example, in the modern world Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all monotheistic religions because they all insist that there is one and only one divine being.
Many passages in Scripture assert God’s singularity by explicitly stating that there is only one God. Listen to just a few examples. In 1 Kings 8:60, Solomon proclaimed:

The Lord is God ... there is no other (1 Kings 8:60).
 
In Psalm 86:10, David sang to the Lord:

You alone are God (Psalm 86:10).

In 2 Kings 19:19, Hezekiah prayed:

You alone, O Lord, are God (2 Kings 19:19).

In Romans 3:30, Paul insisted:

There is only one God (Romans 3:30).

And in James 2:19, James said:

You believe that there is one God. Good! (James 2:19).

There is only one divine being. This was true in the days of the Old Testament. It was true in the days of the New Testament. It was true in the early centuries of the church. And it is still true today.
Now, we need to point out that not all monotheistic religions worship the same god. As we have said, Judaism, Christianity and Islam each worship only one god. And more than this, they all identify this one god as the God of Abraham, at least in name. But the concepts they attach to the name “God of Abraham” are very different. They disagree over his character, his divine actions, and even over his very nature.
Consider Judaism. Judaism bases its faith on the Old Testament, which Christians also do. But they deny the Trinitarian God that the Bible reveals. In fact, they deny each person of the Trinity. They reject Jesus as Lord and God incarnate. They deny that the Holy Spirit is a divine person. And by rejecting Jesus and the Holy Spirit, they deny the Father who sent them. As Jesus himself said in Luke 10:16:

He who rejects me rejects him who sent me (Luke 10:16).

Judaism rejects Jesus and the Holy Spirit, and thereby also the Father. 
Judaism believes that it worships God as he is revealed in the Old Testament. It points to the same Old Testament that Christians love and says, “We worship that God.” So, superficially, there is a sense in which we can say that we worship the same God. But there is another sense in which their god is different from ours because they have rejected the fuller revelation of God in Jesus. 
And when we consider Islam, it is even clearer that their concept of God contradicts the Bible.

An important question is: what does the Islamic faith claim regarding the concept of one God? I believe that Islam affirms a type of unity within God, but Christianity attributes different characteristics and attributes to the Lord than Islam does. We have the doctrines of redemption and incarnation, and those are important doctrines that highlight our Lord’s character in a clear, fundamental way in people’s lives. Both redemption and incarnation are absent from the Muslims’ understanding of God’s unity. 

—	Dr. Riad Kassis, translation


Islam’s conception of God does indeed contradict the Bible, and one of the most significant ways in which it contradicts the Bible is in the assertion that God is an undifferentiated monad. In Islam, if I can explain that technical term, God is absolutely one and there is no community of being within him. In Christian theology there is an absolute fidelity to monotheism, the belief that there is only one God. The very earliest creed of the Bible is, “Hear O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one.” So, an emphatic assertion of monotheism has been a part of the Judeo-Christian theological tradition from its very fountainhead. And so, Christians are monotheists. Now many of our Islamic friends don’t think that we are. They will think that we’re tri-theists. And they will actually think that you believe in the father, and the mother, and the son, because Mohammed was mistaken in this regard in his understanding of the Christian doctrine of God. But that Christian doctrine of the Trinity — that the one God eternally exists in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who are not simply different modes of expression of one deity nor are they simply three different metaphors for the one God, but that there is a real and substantial fellowship between persons in that one true God — that is a radically different conception of God than Islam has.

—	Dr. J Ligon Duncan III

So, Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all monotheistic religions. They are all distinct from polytheism because they deny that multiple gods exist. But they are also clearly distinct from one another because of their very different doctrines of who God is.
Having looked at polytheism and monotheism, we are ready to describe the conception of God affirmed by Christianity and taught in the Apostles’ Creed.


Christianity
	
The statement about God in the Apostles’ Creed is fairly plain. It simply says:

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. 
You’ll notice that the creed does not explicitly say that there is only one God. If we did not know the origin of the creed, it might be possible to read these words as proclaiming faith in the god of Judaism, or the god of Islam. Or even as affirming one god among many. So, how do we know that it is talking about the triune God of Christianity in contrast to non-Christian monotheism and polytheism? 
On the one hand, the creed denies non-Christian monotheism through other things that it says plainly about God. As we saw in a prior lesson, the creed is organized around a Trinitarian formula. It reflects the belief that God the Father, Jesus Christ, his only Son and the Holy Spirit are three different persons in the Godhead, all sharing the same singular divine essence.
Again, recall that the creed was intended to be a summary of beliefs, not a comprehensive statement of faith. And when it was used in the church’s liturgy, everyone in the church knew that to mention these three persons of God in this way was to imply the doctrine of the Trinity. 
On the other hand, the creed denies polytheism by using the singular form of the generic word “god” as a divine name. 
The word “god” can mean many things. Many religions refer to their deities as “gods.” And the Bible itself sometimes uses the word “god” to refer to things like demons, idols, and perhaps even human leaders. But these so-called “gods” also tend to have actual names. For instance, in the religion of ancient Rome, Mars was the god of war, Neptune was the god of the sea, and Jupiter was the leader of the gods. 
In the same way, the God of Scripture is known by actual names. Most of them are descriptive, such as El Shaddai, which is often translated “Almighty God,” meaning the God who is all powerful; and El Elyon, which is usually translated “God Most High,” meaning the God who rules over all; and Adonai, which is generally translated “Lord,” and means master or ruler. 
But the name that most closely approximates what we might think of as God’s proper name is Yahweh. In older translations it appears as Jehovah. But in modern translations, it is generally rendered “Lord,” though its meaning is quite different from Adonai. 
God revealed himself by the name Yahweh extremely early in human history. For instance, human beings were using this name for God at least as early as the days of Seth, the son of Adam, as we learn in Genesis 4:26. Noah referred to God as Yahweh in Genesis 9:26. And Abraham called God by this name in Genesis 12:8.
Yahweh is also the name that God described to Moses in Exodus 3:13-14, where we read this account:

Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” (Exodus 3:13-14).

The name Yahweh is related to the Hebrew word ’ehyeh, which is here translated “I AM.” It is the most intimate name that God revealed to his people, and the one that, more than any other name, distinguishes him from all the false gods.
In fact, of all the names by which the Lord is called in Scripture, “God” is the most generic. In our modern Old Testaments, the word God usually translates the Hebrew word el or elohim. And in the New Testament, it usually translates the Greek word theos. But in the days of the Bible, other religions used these same words to refer to their own gods. So, why did the Apostles’ Creed choose this generic name for God instead of a more distinctive name like Yahweh? Because by using the simple term “God” to identify the Lord, the Apostles’ Creed indicates that the God of Christianity is the only one who deserves to be called “God.” As we read in 1 Kings 8:60:

The Lord (or in Hebrew Yahweh) is God...there is no other (1 Kings 8:60). 

Yes, other religions believe that they worship actual gods. But in reality, they worship imaginary beings, or even demons — inferior, created spirits who are ruled by the Christian God. Paul made this clear in 1 Corinthians 10:20, where he wrote these words:

The sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God (1 Corinthians 10:20).

The pagans did not believe they offered their sacrifices to demons; they believed they offered them to various gods. But they were wrong. 
There are many religions besides Christianity in the world today. There is Hinduism, Shinto, paganism, Wicca, Islam, Judaism, tribal religions, and so on. But their gods are false. Some worship demons. Some worship the creation. And some worship figments of their imagination. But the Bible insists that only the Christian God is truly divine; only the Christian God will judge the world; and only the Christian God has the power to save us.
In its first article of faith, the Apostles’ Creed calls new Christians to abandon the false gods they used to worship, and to acknowledge the God of Scripture as the one true God. And this call reflects a teaching that is absolutely essential in Scripture. The Bible obligates every person in every age to acknowledge that the God of the Old and New Testaments is the only true God. And it demands that they worship only him.
Now that we have looked at God’s singularity, we are ready to focus on his simplicity, the unity of his nature or essence.
