## COMING

We’ve all had times when we believed that certain things were about to happen. But when the time came, what actually occurred was very different from what we’d imagined. In many ways this was true for the authors of the New Testament. The vast majority of Jews living in the first century had firm expectations of how the victory of God’s kingdom was going to come. But the early followers of Jesus gradually learned that it was not coming as they had imagined. So, in a variety of ways, New Testament theology was devoted to explaining how the victory of the kingdom was actually going to arrive. 
To understand how the coming of the kingdom influenced New Testament theology, we’ll touch first on the expectations for the arrival of God’s kingdom. Then we’ll look at New Testament outlooks on what we’ll call the threefold victory of the kingdom. Let’s consider first the expectations for the coming kingdom. 

### EXPECTATIONS

In the first century A.D., all Jews with even a small measure of commitment to their ancestors’ faith longed for the victorious kingdom of God to come. They all hoped that God would defeat their enemies and deliver his people into the blessings of his kingdom. This was true for Jesus’ followers as well. But there were some striking differences as to how and when they expected God’s victorious kingdom to come. 
On the one side, when rabbis and other leaders in Israel taught about the coming of the final victory of God’s kingdom, they referred to familiar Old Testament terminology like “the last days” and “the day of the Lord.” But they also spoke of two great ages of history. Rabbis often referred to the present age of sin, suffering and death as “this age” — olam hazeh in Hebrew — and of the future age of righteousness, love, joy, and peace that would follow the exile as “the age to come” — olam haba’ in Hebrew.
They taught that “this age” reached its low point in the curse of Israel’s exile from the Promised Land. Of course, God was sovereign over this age, and from time to time he revealed, or demonstrated, his kingship in remarkable ways. But by the first century A.D., God’s people had been oppressed and kept from the blessings of God’s kingdom for hundreds of years. The widespread expectation was that in “the age to come,” the enemies of God would be completely defeated and eliminated from the earth. And the people of God would be delivered forever into the immeasurable blessings of God’s worldwide kingdom.

> In biblical literature and also in discussion about the Bible, we sometimes find or encounter the terms “this age” and “the age to come.” What is meant by these terms is the following: “This age” is the age, the period, the era, in which human beings live, the age since the Fall. It is life in a fallen world. “The age to come,” as expected by the Old Testament prophets, was a time where God would reconstitute paradise in some sense; there would be a new heavens and a new earth, and the human heart of stone would be removed, and we all would perfectly follow and do the will of God. There would be no violence among human beings; there would be no violence even in the animal kingdom.
— Dr. Eckhard J. Schnabel 

In the first century, different Jewish sects had different outlooks on what had to happen before history would transition from “this age” to “the age to come.” But most parties agreed that the transition from this age of defeat to the age of God’s victorious kingdom would occur through a catastrophic war. They believed the Messiah, the heir of David’s throne, would lead the angels of heaven and God’s faithful people to victory over God’s human and spiritual enemies. 
The belief that God would defeat not only human enemies, but also spiritual enemies was supported throughout the Old Testament Scriptures. For instance, in Exodus 12:12 God spoke of defeating not only the Egyptians, but the gods of the Egyptians as well. In 1 Samuel 5:1-12 God made war with the Philistines, and also defeated their false god, Dagon. This is why Isaiah 21:9 coupled the defeat of Babylon with the destruction of Babylon’s gods. 
Old Testament passages like Haggai 2:6-9; Zechariah 9–12 and Ezekiel 38–39 were interpreted in Jewish apocalyptic literature as prophecies about the great cosmic war in which the Messiah would lead the armies of God in victory over the nations and the evil spirits who ruled over them. In this way, the Messiah would defeat all of God’s enemies and would deliver all of God’s people into his glorious, worldwide kingdom. 
On the other side, as widespread as these Jewish outlooks were, Jesus’ followers began to anticipate the arrival of victory for God’s kingdom differently. Like the majority of their contemporaries, New Testament authors believed that history divided into two great ages. And they agreed that the Messiah would defeat God’s human and spiritual enemies and deliver God’s redeemed people from “this age” into the blessings of “the age to come.” But Jesus’ followers came to believe that the transition from this age to the age to come would happen in ways that were contrary to what most Jews in their day believed. 
In the first place, unlike most Jews, New Testament authors believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah, the chosen son of David, who would bring the final worldwide victory for God’s kingdom. And this commitment to Jesus as the Messiah deeply shaped everything they wrote in the New Testament. 
We can see this devotion to Jesus’ messianic kingship in the royal titles that the New Testament gives him. For example, the New Testament refers to Jesus with the royal title “Christ” some 529 times. The Greek word Christos translates the Old Testament Hebrew term Meshiach from which we derive our term Messiah. Originally, these terms meant simply, “anointed one.” In Old Testament times, prophets, priests and kings were specially anointed offices in Israel. But by the time of the New Testament, “the Anointed One,” or “the Messiah,” was almost synonymous with the great King of David’s house that would bring about the transition to the age to come. 
A second royal title attributed to Jesus in the New Testament is “Son of God.” This expression, or some variation of it like “the Son” or “the Son of the Most High,” appears some 118 times in the New Testament. This terminology indicated that Jesus was the rightful King of Israel. Listen to John 1:49 where Nathanael said to Jesus: 

> You are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel (John 1:49).

And as Peter put it in Matthew 16:16 when he confessed his faith in Jesus:

> You are the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16).

This expression was similar to a third royal designation for Jesus: “son of David.” We see this in the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke at least 20 times in reference to Jesus as the rightful, God-ordained heir of David’s throne.
For example, in Luke 1:32-33, the angel Gabriel said to Mary at the Annunciation:

> [Jesus] will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end (Luke 1:32-33).

Here Gabriel spoke of Jesus with the royal title “Son of the Most High.” He then explained that Jesus will sit on “the throne of his father David.” Luke recorded that Jesus “will reign … forever [and] his kingdom will never end.” As the Son of the Most High, Jesus is the one who will bring about the final, never-ending victory of the kingdom of God. 
All of these passages point to a crucial teaching in New Testament theology: Jesus is the Messiah who will bring the kingdom of God to the earth in all of its fullness. 
In the second place, Jesus’ early followers believed that he would bring about the transition from this age to the age to come in ways that they and others had not expected. 
Listen to the way Jesus revealed this change of expectations for God’s kingdom in Matthew 13:31-32:

> He told [the crowd] … “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches” (Matthew 13:31-32).

In this parable, Jesus taught that God’s victorious kingdom would begin as something small, “like a mustard seed,” grow for a period of time, and then reach its final culmination. 
Modern theologians often call Jesus’ outlook on the coming of God’s messianic kingdom “inaugurated eschatology.” This phrase refers to the idea that the work of the Messiah has already been manifested on earth, but the final victory is still to come. They also speak of it as the “already, but not yet.” In other words, the victory of God’s kingdom has come already, but not yet in its fullness. This outlook on the victory of God’s coming kingdom offers countless insights into the theology of the New Testament. 

> One of the biggest questions related to the kingdom of God when Jesus announces the kingdom of God is, is it a present reality? Has it come in his words and deeds, or is it still a future entity? Well, scholars talk about the “inaugurated kingdom of God.” The “inaugurated” means that it is both present and future. Jesus announces the kingdom. The kingdom is arriving through his words and deeds, especially through his death on the cross and his resurrection. So, the kingdom is inaugurated, but it’s not yet consummated. When it’s fully consummated, it will fully come to earth, we’ll receive our glorified bodies, we’ll enter into an eternal relationship with God. So, we live in the present day between the times, between the inauguration of the kingdom, its consummation. We still live in these bodies; we still live in this fallen world, yet the kingdom has come because Christ is reigning at the right hand of the Father. He’s also reigning in our hearts. And so, the kingdom has come, it’s “already,” but it is still future. It is “not yet” as well.
— Dr. Mark L. Strauss 

On the whole, it helps to think of the New Testament outlook on the coming of God’s kingdom as a threefold victory. First, in the inauguration, God initiated the victory of the kingdom through Jesus’ life, death, resurrection and ascension, and through the foundational ministries of his first century apostles and prophets. After this, in the continuation, Jesus advanced the victory of God’s kingdom from his throne in heaven. And Jesus will continue to further the kingdom throughout the history of the church. And finally, Jesus will bring the consummation of the kingdom when he returns in glory. This is the final victory of God’s kingdom when all evil will be destroyed and God’s glorious kingdom will extend everywhere in the world. 
As New Testament authors devoted themselves to explaining different sorts of theological matters, they did so in large part in terms of these three stages of Jesus’ messianic work.
As we’ve seen, the coming of the kingdom changed the expectations of Jesus’ followers in the first century. Now, let’s look at the vital place the threefold victory of God’s kingdom held in New Testament theology.
