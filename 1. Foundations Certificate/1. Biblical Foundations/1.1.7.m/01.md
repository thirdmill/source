# Kingdom and Covenant in the New Testament
### Lesson Three
The New Covenant
## INTRODUCTION

Have you ever noticed how followers of Christ use a lot of familiar expressions in different ways? This was certainly the case with the words “new covenant.” We repeat what Jesus said — “This cup is the new covenant” — every time we observe the Lord’s Supper. And all over the world, local churches have names with the words “new covenant” in them. But if you ask most Christians, “What is the new covenant?” you get about as many answers as the number of people you ask. Sometimes differences like this don’t matter much. But as we’ll see in this lesson, the concept of the new covenant influenced New Testament authors so much that we may speak of their theology as “new covenant theology.” And for this reason, we need to do all we can to understand what the new covenant is. 
This is the third lesson in our series Kingdom and Covenant in the New Testament. We’ve entitled this lesson, “The New Covenant.” And in this lesson we’ll explore how New Testament authors relied on the concept of the new covenant to shape some of their most significant theological perspectives. 
Our lesson will divide into two main parts. First, we’ll see how the new covenant characterized God’s kingdom administration. Second, we’ll explore how the new covenant reveals certain dynamics of interaction between God and his people. Let’s look first at God’s kingdom administration through the new covenant. 

## KINGDOM ADMINISTRATION

The Hebrew term we normally translate as “covenant” is “berith.” In the Septuagint, the Greek Old Testament, this Hebrew word is translated “diatheke.” “Diatheke” also appears for “covenant” in the New Testament. Both “berith” and “diatheke” have connotations of “a solemn agreement or pact.” In the Bible, we see covenants between peers. We also see covenants between kings and their citizens and between kings and other kings. And God covenanted with nations and people. In this lesson, we’re particularly interested in God’s covenants with people, especially his new covenant in Christ.
It’s important to know that one of the most significant breakthroughs in our understanding of God’s biblical covenants took place in the second half of the twentieth century. At this time, many scholars began to compare biblical covenants with a group of ancient Near Eastern documents usually called “suzerain-vassal treaties.” These documents were international treaties among nations in Old Testament times. In these treaties, suzerains, or great kings, administered their kingdoms through treaties with vassals, or lesser kings under their authority. As we’ll see, the similarities between biblical covenants and these suzerain-vassal treaties make it clear that God’s covenants in Scripture were his primary means for administering the affairs of his kingdom.

> We see in the Old Testament, especially in the book of Genesis, two different types of treaties exhibited in Scripture. First, we see what we call a “parity treaty” between two people of equal ability, equal authority in which they make an agreement that is mutually beneficial to both. So take for example Abraham and Abimelech… The second kind of treaty that we see is actually between what some people in the ancient Near Eastern called the “suzerainty-vassal treaty,” and that’s usually between unequal powers, one who is stronger and greater, who most likely has already overtaken you and conquered you and would now like to be in a relationship in which the greater person, the suzerain, receives all the benefits from the vassal. So most often it requires allegiance from the vassal to continue to pledge their allegiance to the suzerain… But there is a benefit for the vassal and that is the suzerain will in turn come to its rescue whenever there is any conquering army or invading army that is in their presence, and so they had that kind of mutual protective relationship there as well.
— Dr. Daniel L. Kim

> You know, we think in terms of kings as being oftentimes tyrants and wealthy overlords who oppress their citizens. But in reality, kingship in the ancient Near Eastern context of the time of Jesus and before was largely grounded in the concept of covenant. So we have evidence of treaties, ancient treaties, in which a king, or an overlord, or what’s called suzerain would then enter into an agreement with some people who become essentially his servants or his vassals, and they define the relationship such that the overlord, the suzerain, defines a set of terms by which a relationship can be maintained, and he’d say something like this: “I will offer you protection, I will offer you prosperity, I will offer you identity in exchange for your participation with me by sharing a portion of your crops, by giving me your allegiance and by not forming allegiances with other kings or overlords.” And so it tended to be a very mutual sort of a circumstance in one sense. And if we begin to think about kingship and the nature of covenant in terms of this kind of an agreement, then what we find is that various portions of the Old Testament seem to conform very precisely with the exact elements of these suzerain treaties.

We’ll look at God’s kingdom administration in three main ways. First, we’ll note the significance of covenant representatives. Second, we’ll see how God’s covenants focused on appropriate policies for God’s kingdom. And third, we’ll point out how God administered his kingdom through the organic development of his covenant policies. Let’s look first at God’s covenant representatives.

### COVENANT REPRESENTATIVES

As we’ve already noted, ancient suzerains administered their kingdoms by making treaties with lesser kings or vassals. These vassal kings represented their nations and managed their kingdoms in submission to the suzerain. In a similar way, God administers his kingdom by making covenants through men whom he chose to represent his covenant people. 
To see what we mean, we’ll see first how God chose covenant representatives in the Old Testament. And then we’ll look at the new covenant. Let’s begin with the Old Testament. 

#### Old Testament

It isn’t difficult to see that God chose covenant representatives in Old Testament times. Genesis 1–3 and Hosea 6:7 both indicate that God made the first biblical covenant with Adam. Genesis 6:18 and Genesis 9:9-17 refer to God’s covenant with Noah. And in Genesis 15–17, God made a covenant with Abraham. Exodus 19–24 indicate that God chose Moses as his covenant representative. And finally, passages like Psalms 89 and 132 refer to God’s covenant with David. 
God dealt with each of these men differently as he made his covenants. But all of them represented others before God in the judgments of God’s heavenly royal court. The covenants with Adam and Noah may be called “universal covenants” because Adam and Noah represented all human beings as God’s covenant people. The covenants with Abraham, Moses and David may be described as “national covenants.” In these covenants, these men represented the nation of Israel and the Gentiles adopted into Israel as covenant people.
Keeping the covenant representatives of the Old Testament in mind, let’s see how God administered the new covenant through a covenant representative. 

#### New Covenant

The New Testament repeatedly identifies Christ as the new covenant representative. God engaged him in special ways on behalf of his church — every Jew and Gentile that God identifies with Christ. As we read in Hebrews 9:15:

> Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance (Hebrews 9:15).

Similar teachings appear in passages like Romans 8:34 and 1 Timothy 2:5-6. 
The fact that Christ is God’s chosen covenant representative for the church helps us understand one of the most important characteristics of New Testament theology. As many biblical interpreters have noted, New Testament theology is “Christocentric.” In other words, every facet of New Testament theology is closely tied to the person and work of Christ. But why is this true? For instance, why does the New Testament teach that we must believe in Jesus for salvation? Why pray and show kindness in the name of Jesus? Why is the church called “the body of Christ”? The answer is clear. Christ plays this central role in New Testament theology because God administers every dimension of life in the new covenant through Christ as the representative of the church. To overlook this feature of New Testament theology is to miss one of its most crucial characteristics. 
Having seen that God administered his kingdom through covenant representatives, and specifically through Christ in the new covenant, we should turn to a second feature of God’s kingdom administration: the appropriate policies that biblical covenants established for different periods of biblical history. 

### APPROPRIATE POLICIES

All ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaties had elements in common, but they were also different in many ways. This was because each individual treaty addressed specific issues that were pertinent for each international relationship. In much the same way, all of God’s covenants had much in common, but each covenant’s policies were designed for specific issues that were important at different stages of biblical history. 
To see how the policies of God’s covenants were appropriate for different historical stages, we’ll look once again at Old Testament covenants, and then at the policies of the new covenant. Let’s consider first Old Testament covenant policies. 

#### Old Testament

A cursory reading of the terms of Old Testament covenants reveals a focus on policies that were relevant for particular stages of God’s kingdom.
God’s covenant with Adam may rightly be called the “covenant of foundations.” It emphasized the goals of God’s kingdom and the role of human beings in his kingdom before and after sin entered the world. 
After the flood, God made a covenant with Noah that we may call the “covenant of stability.” This covenant focused on nature’s stability as the secure environment within which sinful humanity could serve God’s kingdom purposes.
We may refer to Abraham’s covenant as the “covenant of Israel’s election.” It focused on the privileges and responsibilities of Israel as God’s chosen people. 
The covenant with Moses is often called the “covenant of law” because it focused on God’s law as he unified the tribes of Israel into a nation. With this covenant, God led the people of Israel toward their promised homeland. 
And finally, we can regard David’s covenant as the “covenant of kingship.” This covenant established Israel as a bona fide kingdom and emphasized how David’s royal dynasty was to lead Israel in kingdom service. 
When we consider the appropriate policies established by covenants in the Old Testament, it shouldn’t surprise us to find that the new covenant also established kingdom policies that were appropriate for the new covenant age.
