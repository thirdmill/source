#### New Covenant

The new covenant comes in the last period of biblical history — after God’s covenants with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and David. And for this reason, the new covenant may be described as the “covenant of fulfillment.” As such, it established policies that were designed to reverse the failures of the past and complete or fulfill God’s kingdom purposes in Christ.
The new covenant is mentioned in Scripture for the first time in Jeremiah 31:31 where we read these words:

> “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah” (Jeremiah 31:31). 

In the larger context of this verse, the phrase “The days are coming” refers to the time after the end of Israel’s exile. As we saw in a previous lesson, the message of the Christian good news — or “gospel” — was that God’s kingdom would reach its final, worldwide victory after Israel’s exile had ended. So, from the first mention of the new covenant, we see its association with the victorious fulfillment of God’s kingdom. 
For this reason, in Jeremiah 31:33-34 God revealed the policies of the new covenant, policies that were appropriate for this last stage of the kingdom in Christ. Listen to what God said:

> This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time … I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, “Know the Lord,” because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest … For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more (Jeremiah 31:33-34).

Notice in this passage that the new covenant will bring God’s kingdom to its ultimate end when “[God] will forgive [his people’s] wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” In this time of final, eternal blessings for God’s people, “[He] will put [his] law in their minds and write it on their hearts.” In fact, God promised to make this true for every person in the new covenant. As he put it, “they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.” 
Now in passages like Deuteronomy 10:16 and Jeremiah 4:4, God frequently called the nation of Israel to move beyond their outward association with his covenants and to circumcise their hearts. In other words, they were to love him deeply by writing his law on their hearts. But in the policies of the new covenant age, God promised to intervene in such a way that this would be a reality for all of his covenant people. 

> After Jesus’ resurrection and ascension, the shape of the kingdom of God remained the same in that God rules over his people in his place, but what that looked like changed entirely. The most significant thing from Jesus sitting at God's right hand is — as the apostle Peter preaches on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2 — he has poured out his Holy Spirit upon his people as was prophesied in the book of Joel. And the indwelling of the Spirit in Jews, and — to their surprise and, at first, kind of shock — also Gentiles, is indication that God’s kingdom is no longer going to be constituted of the people of Israel, the human descendants of Abraham, but those who are descendants of Abraham by faith, as the apostle Paul says in Romans 4. So, God’s kingdom is constituted of people from every tribe, nation and language; whoever has faith in Christ will receive the Spirit, and whoever has the Spirit has God living and ruling in their lives.

As we saw in our preceding lesson, Jesus taught that the new covenant age would unfold over time in three stages. First, its inauguration came with Christ’s first advent. In this stage, Christ fulfilled many, but not all of the expectations of the new covenant. Then, in the continuation, the new covenant age will continue for an indefinite period of time through the history of the church. In this stage, Jesus fulfills many more, but still not all of the expectations of the new covenant. And finally, the new covenant age will reach its consummation at Christ’s second advent when every expectation will be completely fulfilled. 
This threefold fulfillment of the new covenant helps us recognize a second basic characteristic of New Testament theology. Not only was it Christocentric; New Testament theology was also devoted to explaining the policies of the new covenant as it unfolded in these three stages. 
In effect, New Testament authors had to spend their time adjusting expectations for life in the new covenant. For instance, unlike the expectations created by Jeremiah 31, passages like Matthew 6:12 and 1 John 1:9 explain that followers of Christ still need to ask for forgiveness because they still violate the law of God. We also see in passages like 2 Corinthians 11:13 and Galatians 2:4 that false believers remain among true believers in the new covenant church. How were these and other factors affected by the unfolding of new covenant policies? In one way or another, every dimension of New Testament theology was devoted to answering this question. 
Now that we’ve seen how God administered his kingdom through covenant representatives and historically appropriate policies, we should explore the organic development of policies in biblical covenants.

### ORGANIC DEVELOPMENT

When we speak of covenant policies developing organically, we have in mind something like the growth of a tree. A tree changes as it grows from seed to full maturity, but it still remains the same organism. We can look at Old Testament covenants in much the same way. Each Old Testament covenant had different covenant representatives and focused on policies that were appropriate for a particular time in history. But like a tree, there was organic unity despite these changes. 
We’ll look at the organic development of God’s covenants, first in the Old Testament. Then we’ll consider the organic development from the Old Testament to the new covenant. Let’s begin with the Old Testament covenants. 

#### Old Testament

We can see the organic development of Old Testament covenants when we keep in mind how the policies of covenants continued in force throughout Old Testament history. For example, from the time of Adam, God established that the human race, as his image, would spread his kingdom throughout the earth. This policy developed over time, but it was never utterly discarded. 
From the time of Noah, God established the stability of nature as a secure place for God’s fallen images to serve his kingdom purposes. This administrative policy changed in various ways with later covenants, but God never cast it aside. 
From the time of Abraham, Israel was given special privileges and responsibilities as God’s chosen people. This special role in history developed with the addition of more covenants, but it never disappeared from God’s kingdom administration. 
From the time of Moses, the Law served as the guide for Israel. This Law was to be applied differently as other covenants were added, but it was never nullified. 
And from the time of David, David’s royal dynasty has led God’s people in their kingdom service. Although this leadership changed with the new covenant and the kingship of Jesus, it was not set aside. 
The pattern of organic development that we see in the Old Testament continued with the new covenant in Christ. It too developed organically from earlier covenants. 

#### New Covenant

Let’s look again at Jeremiah 31:31 where God said:

> I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah (Jeremiah 31:31). 

All too often, Christians have taken the expression “new covenant” to mean that the new covenant is entirely new, disconnected from earlier covenants in the Bible. It’s important to know, however, that the word “new” translates the Hebrew term châdash. Passages like Isaiah 61:4, Ezekiel 36:26 and Job 29:20 make it clear that this term, and its associated verbal forms, did not mean “utterly new.” Rather, this family of terms meant “renewed,” “renovated,” “rebuilt,” or “refreshed.” 
This outlook is supported by the fact that God said the new covenant will be made “with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.” In other words, the new covenant is a renewed national covenant with the descendants of Abraham and the Gentiles adopted into his family after Israel’s exile ended. 
Of course, like each Old Testament covenant before it, the new covenant established policies that were appropriate for its place in history. These new policies were revealed through Christ and through his apostles and prophets. But like each Old Testament covenant, the new covenant renewed, rebuilt, renovated or refreshed the policies that God had established in previous covenant administrations. 

> When we think of the kingdom of God across the canon of Scripture and across redemptive history, there’s changes in the administration of it as you work through the biblical covenants and reach their culmination in Christ. So, for instance, particularly in the Old Testament, as God brings his salvific plan through the nation of Israel into the old covenant, he’s working primarily with a nation, he’s working primarily in terms of a theocracy, a visible representation in terms of that nation where through them they will bring about the coming of the Messiah, the coming of the Lord Jesus. And you see a lot of the administration of that kingdom tied to them in a particular place, location, land, under particular rule and government and so on. And then as you think of its fulfillment in Christ, as you bring the kingdom to pass in the new covenant, there are some changes. Christ obviously is the King. He is the one who fulfills the type and shadows of the Old Testament. He fulfills the role of David and Moses. And he’s the one who in his life and death and resurrection inaugurates the kingdom, brings God’s saving reign to this world, and then brings about an international community — what we call the church, the one new man, Jew and Gentile together — so that he now rules in and through the church… It is the spiritual rule and reign of Christ through his people as men and women and boys and girls come to faith and repentance. As they believe, they enter that kingdom. The saving rule of God comes to them. That kingdom now is international where the rule of God now brings into it a people that come from every tribe, nation, people and tongue. And it shows itself in the local church where there’s a kind of theocracy there where Christ rules his people in the local church, but not exactly the same way as it was under the nation of Israel of old.

> So, when we think about God's administration of his kingdom and how it might change, we surely don’t want to think of him as a kind of ancient bureaucrat trying to think up a new organizational chart because the first one didn’t work out, so he kind of has “plan B.” It simply can’t be that. His purposes have to be consistent. So, it’s best, I think, to assume that his operating principles are going to be relatively similar and then discern what changes might have been instituted. In this case, I think that fact that Jesus is no longer there is important so that the Spirit comes, so that the church can be empowered not just to center in on the physical Jesus in a given location but is free to disperse with the Spirit of Jesus to bring his message, to bring his mission to the whole world. Now, there is this shift in covenants where what had previously been operative under the flesh is now empowered by the Spirit so that the goal of the old covenant — loving God with all your heart, mind, and soul, and strength, and loving your neighbor as yourself — the believers are now empowered to do that. 
— Dr. Sean McDonough

These organic developments between Old Testament covenants and the new covenant provide us with a third crucial perspective on New Testament theology. In addition to being Christocentric and focused on policies that were appropriate for the threefold unfolding of Christ’s kingdom, New Testament theology was based on Old Testament theology. 
At its core, New Testament theology was not a new faith. Instead, New Testament authors applied the teachings of the Old Testament in the light of God’s revelation in Christ. This is why the New Testament is relatively small. It assumed the abiding validity of the Old Testament. This is also why New Testament authors appealed to the Old Testament hundreds of times to support their theological perspectives. So, when we say that New Testament theology is new covenant theology, we don’t mean that it’s somehow divorced from the Old Testament. On the contrary, every dimension of New Testament theology incorporates and builds on the theology of the Old Testament.
So far in our lesson on the new covenant, we’ve explored God’s kingdom administration. Now we should turn to our second major topic in this lesson: The dynamics of interaction between God and his people in the new covenant.
