EXALTATION

When we talk about Christ’s exaltation, it’s important to remember that it was more than an unveiling of his veiled glory. By his humiliation, the Son earned even greater glory than he originally possessed. He performed works that the Father blessed, and his sacrifice purchased a people for his own inheritance, as well as the right to sit on the throne of the kingdom of God. By these works, the Son’s merit, worthiness and glory actually increased as a result of his humiliation. 
The Apostles’ Creed mentions Christ’s exaltation in the following articles:

The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven And is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead. 
Christ’s divine nature was always immutably exalted. It had not been subjected to death, or removed from his throne in heaven. So, the exaltation of the Son of God was limited to his human nature. Still, like every other experiences of Christ in his human nature, his divine person fully experienced the exaltation.
Our discussion of Christ’s exaltation will divide into four parts. First, we will speak of Christ’s resurrection from the dead. Second, we will talk about his ascension into heaven. Third, we will explore the meaning of his enthronement at the Father’s right hand. And fourth, we will mention the future judgment he will render. Let’s begin with Christ’s resurrection from the dead three days after his crucifixion.


Resurrection

Many Christians don’t realize this, but Christ’s resurrection was just as important to our salvation as his death was. This is why 1 Peter 3:21 talks about being saved by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. You see, our salvation is not merely something that Christ purchased on our behalf, and then gave to us as a gift, even though we often describe it that way. Rather, it is a gift that Jesus gives to us by means of our union with him — this is the idea of being “in Christ” that we hear so much about in the letters of the New Testament. 
We are forgiven through his death because, through our union with him, we died with him on the cross. And we gain eternal life because we were also raised in new life through his resurrection. Scripture speaks about this in Romans 6:3-11, and 8:10-11, 2 Corinthians 5:14 and 13:4, Colossians 2:11–3:3, and many other places. As just one example, Paul wrote these words in Romans 6:4-5:

We were … buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection (Rom. 6:4-5).

In short, the work that Christ did by rising from the dead ensured that we too would have new spiritual life when we come to faith, and that in the future we will receive our own resurrected and glorified bodies, just like his. In this sense, his exaltation is also our exaltation, bringing us dignity, glory and honor.

In dying Jesus is placed beyond the power of sin. You cannot tempt a dead man. He’s placed beyond their demonic powers. But sin turns Jesus over to death, his mightiest ally. So he allows Jesus to meet death, and in meeting death, Jesus conquers death. And the implications of that for his people are stupendous. So, in Revelation 1:18, Jesus the risen glorious Christ declares, I am the living one, I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and hell. He used them to free himself, but he still retains them because one day he will use those keys to liberate his people from bondage to death.

Not only is the cross and the resurrection of Jesus the means by which we can receive forgiveness of sins, atonement for our sins, but as important and maybe even more importantly, the resurrection begins the new and final age of the world. The new creation (as the Scriptures call it) begins at that tomb, that empty tomb. It is the new epicenter/ the new focal point, the new hinge of history itself. We are now all living in the end times, because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He has inaugurated this beginning of the end, and the hope for the Christian is that that beginning will now find its consummation at the second coming of Christ, which is called, according to the Scriptures, a new creation itself.

In addition to the work of resurrection, Jesus’ exaltation also included his ascension from earth into heaven.


Ascension

The ascension was the event where Jesus was taken bodily into heaven. Forty days after his resurrection, Jesus rose on the clouds into heaven. Luke described the ascension in both Luke 24:50-51, and Acts 1:6-11. 
Jesus’ work of ascension accomplished many things that he could not do while he was still on earth. For example, in John 14:2-3, Jesus told the apostles that he was ascending to prepare places for them in heaven. And in John 16:7, he said that he could not send the Holy Spirit to empower the church for ministry unless he first ascended to heaven. 
Beyond this, Jesus actually had to ascend to heaven in order to complete the work of atonement that he began on the cross. The author of Hebrews argued this point in chapters 8–9 of his book. In summary, he said that the earthly temple was a copy of the temple in heaven. And he compared Christ’s atonement to the work that earthly high priests performed on the annual Day of Atonement, when they would take the blood of the sacrifice into the Most Holy Place and sprinkle it on the altar, thereby obtaining forgiveness for the people’s sins. In the same way, Jesus entered the Most Holy Place of the true temple in heaven, and sprinkled his own blood on the altar. And this completed the ceremony of the sacrifice that Jesus had begun on the cross. Listen to the way Hebrews 9:11-12 describes Christ’s atoning work in heaven:

When Christ came as high priest … he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation… [H]e entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption (Hebrews 9:11-12).

Moreover, as our high priest in heaven, Christ continues to intercede for us, continually pleading the benefits of his atonement on our behalf when we sin. Theologians commonly refer to Christ’s ongoing work in the heavenly temple as his session. And it is this session that makes our salvation secure. Hebrews 7:24-25 describes his session in this way:

Because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them (Hebrews 7:24-25).

As we see here, Jesus’ ascension into heaven was a critical aspect of his redemptive work. Without it, we could not be saved.
Having spoken of Christ’s resurrection and ascension, we are ready to address his enthronement in heaven at the right hand of God.


Enthronement
	
The New Testament mentions Jesus’ enthronement at the right hand of God the Father in many, many places. The basic idea is that Jesus is our great human king, and that he has a throne in heaven that sits to the right of the Father’s great throne. In this scenario, the Father is the great high king or suzerain, and the Son is the lesser king or vassal that serves him. This follows the model of kingdoms in the ancient world, whereby lesser kings would rule over various portions of a great empire, and pay tribute and render service to the emperor.

Normally when we think about the kingship of Christ, we think of that as something very exalted, high up there, and because Jesus is now at the right hand of God the Father, and he is the King. But we must remember that Jesus was exalted in his kingship in his human nature. That’s to say, in his divine nature, Jesus was always the King. He was always ruling as the sovereign over all things, but Jesus was given authority in heaven and earth in his human nature. And Jesus is the Son of David, and therefore the one who represents the nation of Israel, and the people of God. And the Son of David, like David himself, was a vassal king; he was a servant of the greater king, God the Father in heaven. 

—	Dr. Richard L. Pratt, Jr.

In passages that mention Jesus in his role as king, he is also spoken of as a priest who intercedes for his people. This follows the model of the ancient world in which kings commonly served as priests. For example, Melchizedek was both priest and king in Genesis 14. 
When Scripture speaks of Jesus’ position at the Father’s right hand, it sometimes emphasizes his role as our messianic king, as in Acts 2:30-36, Ephesians 1:18-23, Hebrews 1:3-9 and 1 Peter 3:21-22. At other times, though, the Bible highlights Jesus’ role as our high priest who intercedes for us. We find this emphasis in passages like Romans 8:34 and Hebrews 8:1. 
In both cases, though, the meaning is the same: Jesus has authority and power over all creation, which he rules over on behalf of the Father. And in that position, he brings salvation to his people, and ensures that the Father looks on them favorably.
After Jesus’ resurrection from the dead, ascension into heaven, and enthronement at the Father’s right hand, the Apostles’ Creed mentions the judgment Christ will render on the last day.


Judgment

When the creed says that Jesus will return in judgment, it states that he will come from there, that is, from his throne at the right hand of God. The idea is that Jesus is the human king over all creation, and that he will render royal judgment against those who have violated his laws and not respected his kingship and kingdom. We see this in Scriptures such as Luke 22:30, Acts 17:31, 2 Thessalonians 1:5, and 2 Timothy 4:1.
The final judgment will include both the living and the dead, that is, everyone who has ever lived, including all those who are alive when Jesus returns. Every word, thought and action of every person will be judged on the basis of God’s character. And the horrible truth is that every human being will be found guilty of sin and condemned to death.
The good news is that those who are united to Christ by faith will already have undergone judgment through Christ’s death, and will already have been vindicated by Christ’s resurrection. So, at the judgment, they will receive an eternal blessing and inheritance. 
But the bad news is that those who are not found in Christ will have to bear the full brunt of God’s wrath in their own persons. They will be cast into hell for all eternity.

In our day today, the doctrine of the last judgment is not very popular. I suppose, though, things haven’t changed very much, for I don’t think judgment was ever attractive to human beings. I would argue that it is absolutely vital to proclaim the judgment — that we ought to proclaim that there is eternal hell for those who do not put their trust in Christ.

One of the reasons that we talk about hell is because it’s the truth. And we dare not escape the truth. And there’s a lot of half truth and sometimes even ninety percent truth, but if you’re going to evangelize well, and you’re going to evangelize with the truth, you’ve got to talk about ultimate judgment. So, we talk about hell and need to. One of the things we recognize about hell is it reminds us who is the judge. We are not; he is. It reminds us about personal responsibility. It reminds us about urgency. It reminds us about eternity. Lots of things that hell can come to us with that, simply, it’s going to be very difficult to approach evangelism minus hell. So, we talk about it. But remember, we talk about it most of all because it’s the truth and we do not want to escape the truth.

CONCLUSION
	
In this lesson, we have explored the articles of faith in the Apostles’ Creed that speak of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have considered his full divinity, including his divine nature and his relationship to the other members of the Trinity. We have also explored his full humanity, including the relationship between his divine and human natures. And we have summarized his work, from the beginning of his humiliation to his ultimate exaltation. 
For those of us who call ourselves Christians, and for all those who want to understand Christianity, it is critical to have a solid grasp of the person and the work of Christ. Jesus is the centerpiece of our religion — the person that sets us apart from all other systems of belief. He is the ruler of the universe, and the fulcrum on which all of history turns. He is our God, our high priest, and our king. And salvation is nothing less than knowing him, loving him, and finding life in union with him.
