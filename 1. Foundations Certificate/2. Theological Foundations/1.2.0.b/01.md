## Prayer Badge

> Give praise to the LORD, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done. Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts. Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.
Psalm 105:1-4

Like most things you truly learn, the idea of prayer and learning about it from Scripture will have no significant impact on your life or ministry unless you actually do it. An ‘academic’ knowledge of prayer will never do. While this badge will help guide you in discussions on prayer as you prepare to do it, the main component of this badge is the actual practice of it. Pray with your group. Pray with your trainer. Pray with your congregation. Pray alone with God. 

### Badge Components :

Looking at God – What do our prayers say about our view of God?
Looking at Ourselves – What do our prayers say about ourselves?
Looking at Our Prayers – What forms do our prayers take, and how can that be expanded?
