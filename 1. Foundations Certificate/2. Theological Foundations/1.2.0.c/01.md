# THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS

The Apostles’ Creed
Building Your Theology 

## Course description

For almost two millennia, there has been a common core of belief among Christians summarized in the Apostles' Creed. At the same time, modern evangelical theology is flooded with conflicting viewpoints. Many of these disagreements arise between denominations, while others arise within denominations and individual churches. The apparent hopelessness of reaching theological unity even with the Apostles’ Creed as a starting point has led some Christians to deny the value of theology altogether. With so many different ideas competing for our loyalty, how are followers of Jesus to determine what to believe? And how committed should we be to specific doctrines and traditions? This course will help you reflect on those pressing questions and is based on two video series produced by Third Millennium Ministries, The Apostles' Creed and Building Your Theology, hosted by Dr. Van Guyton and Dr. Vincent Bacote with contributions from a variety of professors.
