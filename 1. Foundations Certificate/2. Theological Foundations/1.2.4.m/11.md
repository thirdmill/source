## CONCLUSION
	
In this lesson on the Apostles’ Creed, we have looked at the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. We have considered the Spirit’s divinity in terms of the creed and its biblical basis. We have explored his personhood according to his attributes, and in light of his relationship to the Father and the Son. And we have spoken of his works of creative power, sanctification, grace and revelation.
The doctrine of the Holy Spirit is a rich wellspring for Christians. It teaches us about the third person of the Trinity, who is our closest source of help at all times. It points us to the one who is most responsible for motivating and empowering us to live in ways that please God. And it gives us great confidence that God is deeply and personally involved in the world at all times, always working for the benefit of everyone who puts their faith in him.
