## CONCLUSION
	
In this lesson on the Apostles’ Creed, we have explored the doctrine of the church. We have looked at the church’s divine sanction as God’s special community. We have discussed the fact that the church is holy, being both set apart and pure. We have spoken of its catholic or universal nature. And we have explained the ways in which it is a communion of saints. 
As modern Christians, our experience of the church is often very different than it was in the days of the Bible, or even in the days when the Apostles’ Creed was formulated. But the underlying realities of life in the church have never changed. The church is still God’s covenant people. It is still his chosen vessel for bringing the gospel to the world, and for turning the world into his kingdom on earth. We, the church, are holy to the Lord. We are his kingdom. We are his people, united to each other in him. And the Lord himself is working through us.
