# Building Your Theology
Lesson One
What is Theology?

## INTRODUCTION

At one time or another, most of us have seen young children build things. Usually, children don’t make elaborate plans. They simply piece things together as seems best at the moment. But when adults build things, like homes or other buildings, they understand how important it is to have a reliable plan and to execute that plan as carefully as possible. 
In many ways, the same ought to be true when followers of Christ build their theology. Theology isn’t child’s play. We live, work and worship every day of our lives within the structures that Christian theology provides. And for this reason, it’s important to have a reliable plan and to execute that plan as carefully as possible as we build our Christian theology. 
This is the first lesson in our series Building Your Theology. In this series, we’ll explore some of the basic directions we should follow to construct a responsible theology — one that honors God and furthers his purposes for our lives. This lesson is entitled “What is Theology?” Our answer to this question will touch on some essential considerations we must keep in mind as we study and live out Christian theology.
Our lesson will divide into three main parts. First, we’ll look at the definitions of theology. Second, we’ll explore the goals of theology. And third, we’ll touch on the topics of theology. Let’s begin by defining what we mean by the term “theology.”
