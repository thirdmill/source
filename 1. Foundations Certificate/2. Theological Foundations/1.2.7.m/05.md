### PRIMARY GOALS

In many respects, the definitions of theology that we’ve already explored provide a starting point for distinguishing several goals of theology. On one side, defining formal theology primarily as a science, with an academic orientation, indicates that one goal is teaching or developing doctrines that focus on intellectual matters. On the other side, defining theology with a life orientation indicates that another goal is to develop teachings or doctrines that focus on the broader issues of our whole lives in Christ. 
We’ll build on these two orientations by speaking of three primary goals for theology. First, we’ll consider what has often been called orthodoxy. Second, we’ll explore what a number of recent theologians have called orthopraxis. And third, we’ll discuss a primary goal that is often overlooked in formal Christian theology called orthopathos. Let’s start with what we mean by orthodoxy. 


#### Orthodoxy

The term “orthodoxy” is sometimes used to identify particular branches of the church, like the orthodox churches of eastern Christianity. But here we’ll use the word in its generic sense simply to mean: 

**right or straight thinking**

The goal of orthodoxy is to reach right or true doctrines. No matter what our denomination or church, when we build theology we’re interested, to one degree or another, in the truthfulness of what we believe. We want to believe the right things about God and other matters in relation to God. So, it’s not hard to see why this conceptual goal has been emphasized by those who follow an academic orientation toward theology.

Theologians are right to make orthodoxy a primary goal of their theological work. Today, with rapid communication and worldwide shifts in populations, we encounter faiths other than Christianity at nearly every turn. This leaves many people confused about what to believe. Even many Christian theologians wonder if we really can be so sure about the traditional truth claims of our faith. Besides the confusing influences from outside the Christian community, it’s also difficult to find Christians within the church who understand and can agree on more than a handful of core doctrines. 
In spite of these current tendencies, we should reaffirm that developing orthodox outlooks — a set of what we would call “true doctrines” — should be one of the chief goals of theology. We must always remind ourselves that in Jesus’ day there were many religions, and even many theological differences among the Jews. But despite the challenges that this diversity raised, Jesus insisted on the pursuit of orthodoxy. He spent much of his earthly ministry correcting falsehoods and teaching his followers what they should believe. He proclaimed, without hesitation, that his followers had to be people who sought truth. 


Listen to Jesus’ prayer for his apostles in John 17:17:

> Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth (John 17:17). 

Jesus was deeply concerned with true doctrine. Many today believe that we can be sanctified — set apart for God’s service — without learning true theological concepts. But Jesus prayed that the apostles would be sanctified by the truth of God’s word. He affirmed that orthodoxy is one of the principal goals of theology, and as his followers, we must do the same. 
Now, as important as it is to affirm the primary goal of orthodoxy, Christians must also acknowledge the goal of orthopraxis. 


#### Orthopraxis

As the word itself indicates, orthopraxis amounts to focusing on:

**right behavior or practice**

![1.2.7.m.pic04.png](https://github.com/thirdmill/images/raw/main/1.2.7.m.pic04.png)
This term has moved to the foreground of many theological discussions in recent decades, especially among those who have taken up a life orientation toward theology. You’ll recall that William Ames described the marrow, or core of theology as the doctrine of “living to God.” One aspect of living to God is our practice or behavior. It’s not enough simply to think correctly about theological concepts. We must also put these concepts into practice. Here we have in mind specifically physical behaviors. For instance, in theology we learn that we are to pray, evangelize, worship, serve each other, and give generously to the poor. But learning about these and other truths is not enough for responsible Christian theology. These truths must be translated into proper actions — into orthopraxis. 
 
> The relationship between theology and orthopraxis, or the way in which that theology works itself out in our lives, is crucial in part because it’s not just about what we believe, but how what it is that we believe works itself out in our lives. You could think back to the early church, for example, about the Gnostics, and for the Gnostics it was all about just having this right belief, these secret understandings of God and his word and who Jesus was. And it didn’t matter how that worked itself out in one’s life because everything about this world, everything about this earth is accidental — there is no sense in which the behavior that relates to what one believes matters. But Christ doesn’t say that at all. In his own teachings, and in the writings throughout the rest of the New Testament, and indeed throughout the whole Old Testament, God is saying to his people, “You are my people, and as such, because we have this relationship, you are my emissaries to the world. What it is that you do reflects your relationship with me.” And so, it’s an inextricable bond between what we believe and how we behave, how we go about living that out, either in terms of ministry and those that are called to be leaders of a church or a ministry and how they shepherd the flock, or even those just within the church that are living out their faith in their own ministry calling that God has called them to in their work or life or school. What we believe and how that works itself out in our lives is absolutely an essential relationship.

Sadly, evangelicals face several enormous challenges in maintaining their interest in the theological goal of orthopraxis. First, people outside of the church constantly bombard us with the lie that there are no moral absolutes, that no behaviors are particularly good or bad. So, many of us grow weary of standing against the tide of our cultures by insisting that there are right and wrong ways to behave. 
But even from within the church, some of our reticence to make orthopraxis a crucial goal stems from how we as Christians have failed in this endeavor in the past. The church has committed many sins in the name of truth. We look into the history of the church and see horrendous behaviors that were supported by serious theological reasoning. It’s a sad fact of history that religious people, even sincere Christians, often use their theology to justify all kinds of terrible sins. 
But despite these serious difficulties, orthopraxis is still critical because our behavior still matters to God. Our good and bad works still affect our eternal rewards. The good things we do can also be God’s means of ministering to our fellow Christians. We can still present a powerful witness for Christ to the unbelieving world through proper behavior. For these and other reasons, orthopraxis must be an essential goal of theology. 
Now we need to be cautious on many levels. Humility and love must characterize our behavior at every turn. And we mustn’t reduce Christian life to mere actions. Scripture is clear that we cannot earn our salvation through good works. Still, theology should never be concerned merely with conceptual correctness, but also with teaching and doing the right kinds of actions. Listen to James 2:19 where James warned against pursuing orthodoxy without orthopraxis: 

> You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe — and shudder (James 2:19). 

In this passage James made a remarkable claim. In many respects, demons are orthodox. They believe that God is one. And they believe this truth so deeply that they “shudder” in fear. But the demons’ orthodoxy does them no good because they refuse to submit to God in their practices. 

> James is writing to Jewish Christians scattered abroad, and he picks up on their central confession of faith. He says, “Do you believe that God is one?” Well, that comes from the Shema, a prayer that they prayed every day from Deuteronomy. He says, “Well, if you believe that, you do well. But also, the devils believe and they tremble.” Well, what’s the difference between believing like the devils even believe and then faith that really means something, that actually saves us and creates a relationship with God? Well, the difference is in loving God and obeying God. James is focusing on not just reading the Word, not just hearing God’s words, not just embracing them in the idea, but following them, attaching our affections to God. Jesus said it this way, he said, “If you love me, you’ll keep my commandments.”

In addition to the primary goals of orthodoxy and orthopraxis, we must also mention the goal of orthopathos. 


#### Orthopathos

This terminology is not widely used, but it’s not difficult to understand. The term “orthopathos” means:

**right or correct feelings or emotions**

Living for God involves making sure that our deepest sentiments are used in his service. Our joys, our disappointments, our yearnings, our anger, our exhilaration and a host of other emotions must be brought into conformity with the will of God. Unfortunately, if academic theologians tend to overlook any goal of theology, it’s the goal of orthopathos. Neglect of the emotional dimension of theology occurs for at least two reasons. 
![1.2.7.m.pic05.png](https://github.com/thirdmill/images/raw/main/1.2.7.m.pic05.png)
First, many academic theologians are often psychologically inept at expressing or exploring emotions. In fact, the often-sterile academic model frequently influences people to take up careers in academic theology — becoming professors and teachers — so they can avoid confronting the emotional dimensions of life. Consequently, it’s not surprising to find about as little excitement, joy, pain, sympathy, care and love expressed in academic theological writings as you do in academic botany textbooks. If you’ve ever read much academic theology, you know that very little attention is given to emotional matters. Sadly, this occurs most often because professional theologians themselves do not value emotions, or they simply haven’t developed themselves emotionally.
A second obstacle to orthopathos is that many evangelicals have fallen into the trap of believing that feelings are amoral, or morally neutral. It’s not appropriate, they say, to speak of some feelings being right and others wrong. They believe that the notion of orthopathos — right feelings — is entirely misguided. But it’s interesting to note that as widespread as the amoral outlook on emotions may be, it is much more in line with certain modern psychological theories than it is with the Bible’s perspectives. 

> When you think about the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5 — love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control — when you think about those words, they’re highly emotional. And what this tells us is that the work of Holy Spirit in the life of the believer impacts the emotions. So, emotions are not morally neutral. There are good emotions, and there are bad emotions. There are righteous emotions, and there are evil emotions. Now, we often have a hard time distinguishing those in this situation and that situation, but the fact is, is that the more we think along the lines of what the Bible teaches us, the more we’ll be asking questions like, is my emotion correct for this situation? Is my feeling about this circumstance the way God wants me to feel about it? The fact that the fruit of the Spirit involves all kinds of emotional terms like kindness and gentleness and self-control and things like that — love, joy, peace, patience — I mean, what could be more emotional than those kinds of words? And the truth is, then, that emotions must be a part of Christian theology. When we think about the Bible and when we apply the Bible to life, it must impact our emotional lives. Not just our intellectual lives, not just our behaviors, but our emotions as well.
> 
> — Dr. Richard L. Pratt, Jr.
 

> The Bible tells us a lot about how we’re to think about God, how we’re to act toward God, and also what we’re to feel about God. So, the Bible is very clear that emotions are not morally neutral. Emotions are one of the ways that we are to glorify God with the whole of who we are… I pray that every aspect of my emotional response to the Lord and my emotional response to my life and what happens in my life would reflect who God is, who he’s made me, and how he’s made me to respond to this broken world, but this world also that he’s redeeming and going to bring to fruition as he creates the new heavens and new earth.

A wonderful example of pathos within theological writing is found in the writings of the apostle Paul. We all know that Paul was concerned with orthodoxy. He was committed to pursuing the truth. Yet, time and again, as he wrote about truth, Paul could not contain his feelings. His reflections on orthodoxy caused spontaneous emotional outbursts. As just one example, listen to Romans 11:33-36 where Paul broke out in exuberant praise: 

> Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! “For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” “Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?” For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen (Romans 11:33-36).

Now when was the last time you read something like that in the middle of an academic theological treatise?

> The book of Romans, in the first 11 chapters, teaches us all the depth of who God is and what he has done. In each chapter, Paul is adding something more, and when you get to chapter 11, at the end of chapter 11, the apostle is expressing all that greatness of what he has known of God… When you come to know God in that way, as he did — that merciful, loving, just, good, powerful God — you cannot avoid coming to a physical, spiritual, total worship in your being, a grand expression, an awesome expression of worship of God, because you recognize and understand who he is.

Now that we’ve identified three primary goals of theology, we should comment on their interdependence. This interdependence is an important reason why we can’t ignore any one of these goals. In fact, they are so intertwined that we can’t be strong in one area without being strong in the other two.
