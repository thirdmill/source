## TOPICS

Introducing someone to the theological enterprise is like introducing someone to the universe. It’s a daunting task to say the least. So, in these lessons, we’ll have to narrow our focus in theology to just a few topics. 
To understand the topics that will interest us, we’ll touch on two matters: first, the many options before theologians; and second, the selections we’ll make in these lessons. Let’s look first at the options that await anyone who ventures into the formal study of theology. 


### OPTIONS

When people first enter the serious pursuit of theology, they’re often overwhelmed by the large scope of the field. It’s common to think of theology as covering a long list of subjects. Throughout the two millennia of the Christian faith, a number of topics have come to occupy those who focus much attention on theology. The list of subjects differs from one branch of the church to another, but there are enough similarities that we can name a number of major theological categories. 
The pursuit of theology normally includes some relatively practical topics like: 
•	missions 
•	evangelism 
•	apologetics — or defending the faith
•	worship 
•	mercy ministries 
•	pastoral counseling, and 
•	homiletics — or preaching 

It also includes a vast array of more theoretical or abstract subjects like: 
•	soteriology — the doctrine of salvation 
•	ecclesiology — the doctrine of the church 
•	anthropology — the doctrine of humanity 
•	pneumatology — the doctrine of the Holy Spirit 
•	Christology — the doctrine of Christ 
•	theology proper — the doctrine of God
•	eschatology — the doctrine of end times 
•	biblical theology — theology of redemptive history recorded in the Bible 
•	systematic theology — the logical arrangement of biblical teaching
•	historical theology — tracing the development of doctrines in the history of the church, and 
•	hermeneutics — or interpretation

Now for the most part, traditional academic theology has focused on these topics primarily from the vantage point of orthodoxy, or the right way of thinking about these matters. A typical seminary class on any of these subjects will concentrate on getting the concepts straight — making sure that everyone is thinking properly. Occasionally, some seminary classes will concentrate on learning skills. Classes that focus on worship, evangelism, counseling, and homiletics — preaching — normally have a significant concern for skills or orthopraxis. Unfortunately, it’s not common for seminary classes to concentrate on orthopathos, or the emotional dimensions of theology, even in a homiletics class. Yet, as we’ve learned in this lesson, a more adequate approach to the topics of theology requires deepening our concern in all three directions. So, we can see that the task before a student of theology is colossal. With every topic of theology, there are countless directions to pursue. 
As you might imagine, the long list of topics and the many options that we face when building our theology leads to the necessity of making selections. We have to choose the topics and the emphases that we will pursue.


### SELECTIONS

Everyone who builds houses will tell you that it’s good to learn from what others have done. But at the same time, builders must also determine what it will take to complete their own projects. Well, in many ways, the same is true for us as we build Christian theology. It’s good to learn from other followers of Christ. There’s much to learn from the topics they’ve identified and how they’ve handled those topics. But at the same time, each of us must still determine what it will take to build our own theology — theology that furthers our service to God. 
There’s a grave danger that new students of theology face. The number and complexity of theological topics can be overwhelming. In fact, the field is so large that many students can do little more than barely learn the raw data of these topics. As a result, students often find themselves focusing almost exclusively on orthodoxy because there’s so little time to explore other dimensions. 
Well, in these lessons we want to avoid becoming overwhelmed by the vast array of theological topics. So, rather than trying to introduce the entire encyclopedia of theology, we’re going to limit ourselves to just a few, select subjects. As we move forward, we’ll concentrate on the aspects of theology that we’ll call pastoral theological concerns. What we mean by this is those sets of beliefs, practices, and pathos that are more directly beneficial for pastors and church leaders. We’ll be asking ourselves questions like: How do people training for church leadership need to approach the study of theology? What do they need to know? What do they need to do? And what do they need to feel theologically?
Happily, we don’t have to invent answers to these questions. The church has already pointed in several important directions. As theological education has developed over the centuries, a consensus has grown among a variety of denominations throughout the world. Today, there’s general agreement on the kinds of topics that need to be covered when educating leaders in the church.

> When it comes to discussing which theological topics are important in developing Christian leaders, one can think of any number of them. First of all, the Bible, from the Old Testament to the New, is all about God’s kingdom and holy covenant. There are also the traditional topics of systematic theology, such as theology proper, Christology, pneumatology, anthropology, eschatology and so forth. Of course, there are even more relevant topics such as practical theology and church history. For me, as someone who especially focuses on the development of church leaders, they need to know how to evangelize, pray, and have the gift of teaching. Evangelism in particular isn't just a matter of teaching a crowd, but a church leader has to lead disciples just as Jesus did with the Apostles. The scope involved here is quite broad.

A typical seminary curriculum is often divided into three major divisions that look something like this: the biblical division; the doctrinal and historical division, and the practical division. These three divisions represent major ways the Holy Spirit has led the church to develop theological education for its leaders. Let’s unpack each area starting with the biblical division.
The biblical division normally divides into Old Testament studies and New Testament studies. These areas of the curriculum focus on the content of Scripture and expose future church leaders to responsible interpretation of the Bible. The doctrinal and historical division often divides into church history and systematic theology. Church history focuses on how God has developed theology in the church as the body of Christ has struggled against the world in different ways at different times. Systematic theology exposes students to the ways the church has organized the teaching of the Bible into logical or systematic arrangements. Finally, the practical division draws attention to students’ personal spiritual development and practical ministry skills such as preaching and evangelism.

As we progress through this series of lessons, we’ll acknowledge the important contours of these theological divisions. We’ll look into the ways each of these areas of theology function and how they work together as we pursue theology. In addition, we’ll keep all three of our theological goals in mind as we study each division. We’ll not only focus on orthodoxy, but on orthopraxis and orthopathos as well. And in this way, we’ll work toward building a responsible Christian theology. 



## CONCLUSION

In this lesson we’ve explored the most basic question we can ask as we venture into theology, namely, “What is theology?” We’ve touched on three aspects of this question: the definitions of theology, the goals of theology and the topics of theology. 
 It’s the privilege and responsibility of every follower of Christ to build theology. And as we’ve seen in this lesson, doing this in a formal way presents both challenges and opportunities. We must be mindful to avoid paths that harm how we think, act and feel about the Christian faith. And we must do all we can to pursue theology in ways that enhance how we think, act and feel as servants of Christ. The issues we’ve addressed in this lesson are so basic that they will impact this entire series of lessons on Building Your Theology. And by God’s grace, we’ll be better equipped to build theology that honors Christ and furthers his kingdom in our personal lives and in the church throughout the world.
