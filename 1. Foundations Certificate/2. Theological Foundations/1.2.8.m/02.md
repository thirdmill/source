## CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY 

Although we often speak of “Christian theology,” the meaning of this expression isn’t altogether clear. Some people refer to Christian theology as what Christians actually believe. But we all know that many Christians believe things that are not genuinely Christian. Others speak of Christian theology as what Christians ought to believe. But we have to admit that we don’t always agree on what we ought to believe. Because of these and similar complexities, we need to clarify what we’ll mean in this series when we use the term “Christian theology.” 
We’ll touch on three matters: First, we’ll look at some of the problems with creating definitions for Christian theology. Second, we’ll propose a working definition of Christian theology. And third, we’ll note the unity and diversity that Christian theology entails. Let’s look first at some of the difficulties we encounter as we try to define Christian theology.


### PROBLEMS WITH DEFINITIONS

One of the greatest problems we have is finding ways to distinguish Christian theology from non-Christian theology. Sometimes the differences aren’t hard to see, but many times it’s extremely difficult to separate Christian theology from other theologies. When we consider Christianity alongside other major religions of the world, there are a number of theologies that are easily distinguished from Christian beliefs. For example, although some people have tried to combine Christianity and Hinduism, the polytheism of Hinduism makes it very different from Christian faith. The worship of many gods rather than the worship of one God makes it hard to confuse the two. 
Islam, on the other hand, is much closer to Christianity. Like Christianity, Islam traces its heritage back to Abraham. And more than this, the prophet of Islam interacted with Christian teachings as he and his followers composed the Quran. So, there are a number of similarities between Christianity and Islam. Still, for the most part, we don’t have great difficulty distinguishing Islam from Christian faith because there are pronounced and fundamental differences between them. For instance, Christianity affirms the deity and supremacy of Christ, in contrast to Islam’s denial of these truths. 
And what about Judaism? Judaism is even more closely connected and similar to Christianity because Christianity grew out of Judaism. Nevertheless, because Judaism denies that Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ, very few people confuse it with Christian faith. The theological perspectives of these and other major world religions are so different from Christian theology that most people have little difficulty separating them. We can erect fairly solid boundaries between our theology and theirs.

> Well, what distinguishes Christianity from Judaism and Islam in terms of theology, of course, is about the person of Christ, the focus. All religions are about some sort of faith belief. Those other religions, of course — Judaism and Islam — are about a belief in God here, just as we have in Christianity… And the story, I think, that’s different for us, growing out of Judaism, is that God keeps his promises… Christ in Christianity becomes the fulfillment of all of those previous promises. He becomes the fulfillment of that Messiah, who does, in fact, save people from their sins. He becomes that person who does, in fact, not just give his life as a martyr, but someone who actually provides a way for us to be redeemed, to be justified, to be forgiven.

At the same time, many schools of theology blend Christian and non-Christian thought, making it difficult at times to separate genuine Christianity from other faiths. We’ll see such syncretism in our day in popular Christian cults, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormonism, and Christian Science. It can even be found in many churches and denominations that have abandoned the theological stances of their forebearers in favor of modern liberalism. Now, some aspects of these syncretistic religions are easily distinguished as non-Christian, but other elements are very close to true Christianity. For this reason, in these cases, we have difficulty drawing sharp lines between Christian and non-Christian theologies.
To make matters worse, think about the theological landscape among faithful believers in Christ. Even within the realm of genuine Christianity, it’s often easier to speak of Christian theologies — in the plural — than Christian theology. There are so many different forms of Christianity that it’s impossible to identify to everyone’s satisfaction which forms of Christianity should be considered genuine. Does true Christian theology include the teachings of the Eastern Orthodox churches? How about Roman Catholic doctrines? Which is the purest form of Protestant faith: Anglican? Baptist? Lutheran? Methodist? Presbyterian? Nearly every segment of the church evaluates the purity of the various branches of Christianity in its own way. And almost every branch believes that its theology is the purest version of all. When we think about it in terms of these Christian intramural disagreements, it becomes even more difficult to define “Christian theology” precisely.
Think about it this way: What if you were asked to distinguish Christian theology from all other theological systems in the world by writing all the doctrines that people must believe in order to be counted as Christians. You may say: Jesus is the Lord; Jesus is the Savior; Jesus is the only way of salvation; Jesus died for our sins; Jesus was resurrected from the dead; God is Triune; Jesus is fully God and fully man; all people are sinners; justification is by faith alone; Christians must be holy; the Bible is the inerrant Word of God. Well, when we look at all of these concepts, it becomes pretty clear that a person would have to be very well-educated and informed even to understand all of them, much less believe them all.
Now, of course, the doctrines we listed are important Christian teachings. But it should be evident that a person may have genuine Christian faith and Christian theology without hearing about some of these doctrines, much less understanding or believing all of them. So, which doctrines are absolutely essential for Christian faith? What is the bare minimum of Christian theology? In truth, only God knows for certain exactly where that line is drawn.
These are the kinds of problems we face as we try to define Christian theology. In relation to some other religions, it’s not difficult to distinguish ourselves, but it’s very difficult to know precisely what elements are essential for a theology to be genuinely Christian.
These and other problems with defining Christian theology lead us to propose a working definition that will guide our discussions in these lessons. This definition won’t answer every question that may be raised, but it will provide us with a significant and helpful measure of clarity. It won’t be a perfect definition, but it will be sufficient to use as we proceed.


### WORKING DEFINITION

In these lessons, we’ll orient our definition of Christian theology to the well-known and ancient expression of Christian faith called the Apostles’ Creed. This creed existed substantially in its current form by about 200 A.D. and came to its present form around 700 A.D. Christians from all over the world have recited this creed for centuries as a summation of their Christian faith:

> I believe in God the Father Almighty,
> Maker of heaven and earth.
> I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
> Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
> And born of the virgin Mary.
> He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
> Was crucified, died, and was buried;
> He descended into hell.
> The third day he rose again from the dead.
> He ascended into heaven
> And is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
> From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
> I believe in the Holy Spirit,
> The holy catholic church,
> The communion of saints,
> The forgiveness of sins,
> The resurrection of the body,
> And the life everlasting. Amen.

This worldwide expression of Christian faith summarizes Christianity in very simple and essential ways. And it will serve as our basic definition of Christian theology. For our purposes, all theology that accords with this creed will be counted as Christian theology. 

> Adopting the Apostles’ Creed as our basic definition of what constitutes Christian theology is very important because it’s important to distinguish true Christianity from so-called “Christian” cults and even other religions that may be similar to Christianity in some ways or another. But at the same time, we always have to remember that it’s not as clean-cut as we might want to say. I mean, for instance, does anyone really want to say that the fact that Jesus suffered under Pontius Pilate is critical to the Christian faith? Now, we may want to say, yes, it’s important that we believe that Jesus actually lived on this planet, but Pontius Pilate himself? Probably not. And so, there are things like that in the creed that we might quibble over this detail or that detail. And in addition to that, some of us would want to add other things to those essentials of the Christian faith. For example, the Apostles’ Creed does not mention the Bible. It doesn’t mention the inerrancy of the Bible or the infallibility of Scriptures or sola Scriptura or anything like that… So, when we think about adopting the Apostles’ Creed as our standard, our operating definition of what orthodox Christianity is, we have to keep those subtleties in mind. But at the same time, the Apostles’ Creed connects us to the church through the centuries, and it connects us broadly to the true body of Christ even today around the world. So, it’s a helpful way of summarizing Christianity and distinguishing it from Christian cults and from other religions.

> The Apostles’ Creed is central to our understanding of the Christian faith. It reflects the core beliefs of what it means to be Christian. And you see that outlined in the various statements that are there. It defines, in many ways, what I would argue to be the perimeter of orthodoxy. It talks about how the Father and the Son relate to one another, how we relate to God, and how God relates to creation. And those three elements are central to our understanding of this life, salvation, our relationship with God… And what the Apostles’ Creed does is it helps set that as a perimeter, defining how each of those relationships ought to be conceived as we understand it through the Word of God.

For example, the creed mentions creation. It mentions all three persons of the Trinity: the Father, Jesus Christ his only Son, and the Holy Spirit. It refers to the incarnation, death, resurrection, and the ascension of Jesus. It also speaks of the forgiveness of sins, the general resurrection, the final judgment, and the hope of everlasting life. Because it provides such a strong and broad foundation, we’ll use the Apostles’ Creed as our working definition of Christian theology. Although we’ll speak of doctrines that go far beyond this short list, for our purposes, we can be satisfied that a theology is Christian if it accords with this creed. 
To overcome our problems with definitions of Christian theology, we’ve used as our working definition the text of the Apostles’ Creed. In doing so, it immediately becomes apparent that there is both unity and diversity within the theology of the Christian faith.
