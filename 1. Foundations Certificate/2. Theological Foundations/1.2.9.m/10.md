## CONCLUSION

In this lesson, we’ve explored how relying on God’s revelation helps us build our Christian theology. We saw that in the process of finding revelation, God has given us special and general revelation, and we must depend on his revelation in creation and in Scripture together. We also noted that understanding revelation is harmed by the effects of sin, but is furthered by the illumination of the Holy Spirit. And finally, we saw that developing confidence in our theological beliefs depends to a large degree on deferring to the influences of biblical exegesis, interaction in community, and Christian living. 
When we build Christian theology, we must rely on God’s revelation everywhere it’s found. But understanding and applying divine revelation can be difficult. So, every step of the way, we need to refresh our commitment to the processes that enable us to draw from his revelation. Only then can we hope to formulate our doctrines, the standards of our practices, and the conditions of our hearts in ways that please God.
