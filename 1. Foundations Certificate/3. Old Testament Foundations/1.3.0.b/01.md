## Discipleship Badge

> And he said to all, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
Luke 9:23-24

Christian discipleship is following Jesus and growing in him in your Christian life. It can be about a lot of things. It can be about character formation. It can be about growing in our knowledge of the Scriptures. It can be about developing the skills necessary to spread Christ’s love and message to others. But one thing it will always be about is walking with Jesus in awe and humility as a learner and follower of him. And this we do together. Discipleship can look different depending on what is needed and where you live. In this badge, you will discuss what elements need to be included in discipleship and where and how to do it for others.

### Badge Components – Discussion topics will come from these three areas:

Culture – Discipleship where you live
Church – Discipleship where God has called you
Personal – Discipleship where you become what God has called you to be
