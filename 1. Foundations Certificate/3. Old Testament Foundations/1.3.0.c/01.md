# OLD TESTAMENT FOUNDATIONS
## THE PENTATEUCH with THE PRIMEVAL HISTORY and FATHER ABRAHAM

### Course description

The first five books of the Old Testament are commonly called the Pentateuch. They tell the story of the nation of Israel from creation to preparation for the conquest of the Promised Land. But is the Pentateuch simply the historical account of Godâ€™s chosen people, or is it something more? This course explores the books of Genesis and Exodus, examining why they were written, what they meant to their original audience, and how we should respond to them today. This course is based on the lecture series, The Pentateuch,  The Primeval History and Father Abraham, produced by Third Millennium Ministries and hosted by Dr. Scott Redd  and Dr. Richard L. Pratt, Jr. with contributions from a variety of professors.
