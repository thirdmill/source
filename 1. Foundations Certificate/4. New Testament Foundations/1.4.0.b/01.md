## Teaching/Preaching Badge

> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.
Luke 24:27

Explaining the message of the Bible clearly and faithfully takes work. Whether you are in the front of the classroom or standing in the pulpit, people need to have a clear picture of the Bible’s message on any number of topics. On the road to Emmaus, Jesus took the time to explain who he was to the disciples. This badge focuses on that singular task. With your trainer as a guide, you will look to develop and sharpen your skills in teaching and preaching so that you might proclaim the Scriptures faithfully. 

## Badge Components:

Faithful to the Text – Say what your passage says
Faithful to the Subtext – How does your lesson/sermon point to Jesus and his work?
