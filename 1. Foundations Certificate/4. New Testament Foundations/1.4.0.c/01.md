# NEW TESTAMENT FOUNDATIONS
The Gospels
The Book of Acts

### Course description

The first five books of the New Testament are key books of the Bible, since they narrate the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus, as well as the beginnings of his church. Each of the four gospels has a unique perspective and a unique purpose. In lessons one through five, this course explains the background, the structure, the main contents, and the major themes of each gospel. In lessons six through eight, we'll look at the Book of Acts, exploring Luke's main points as he wrote and providing the framework he gave his readers as a context for understanding primary and secondary matters. This course is based on two Thirdmill video series, The Gospels and The Book of Acts, produced by Third Millennium Ministries and hosted by Dr. Pete Alwinson and Dr. Hans F. Bayer.
