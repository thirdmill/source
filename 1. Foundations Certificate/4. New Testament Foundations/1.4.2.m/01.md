# The Gospels
Lesson Two
The Gospel According to Matthew

## INTRODUCTION

In 1919 King Albert of Belgium was traveling across the United States by train. He was something of an authority on locomotives, so for a ten-mile stretch he dressed as an engineer and ran the train. At the next stop, the cheering crowd looked for King Albert but couldn’t find him. They expected the king to look a certain way, and to act in a certain way. So, they didn’t realize that the tall man dressed in a flannel shirt and a railroad cap was actually the king of Belgium.
	From one perspective, the Gospel of Matthew tells a similar story. It’s the story of a king — Jesus, the King of the Jews. But many in his day didn’t recognize him because he didn’t look the way people expected him to look, and he didn’t act as they expected him to act. He was a different kind of king.
	This is the second lesson in our series The Gospels. We have entitled this lesson “The Gospel According to Matthew,” because we will focus our attention on the first gospel, the book of Matthew. 
	Our study of Matthew’s gospel will divide into three parts. First, we’ll consider the background of Matthew’s book. Second, we’ll explore its structure and content. And third, we’ll look at some major themes in Matthew’s gospel. Let’s begin with the background of the Gospel According to Matthew.
