# The Gospels
Lesson Four
The Gospel According to Luke

## INTRODUCTION

Several years ago, the news reported that a group of people was trapped in a burning office building. Then a young man burst into the room and they followed his voice to safety. Stories from many survivors throughout the building revealed that he was a volunteer fireman who happened to work in the building. Although he lost his own life in the fire, he saved many others from certain death.
More than any other gospel writer, Luke described Jesus as one who saves. Whether we realize it or not, humanity is lost and desperate, without help or hope. We have no way to escape the judgment of God that threatens us. But the Gospel of Luke reminds us that at the cost of his own life, Jesus came to save us. 
This is the fourth lesson in our series The Gospels, and we’ve entitled it “The Gospel According to Luke.” In this lesson, we’ll explore how to read the New Testament’s third gospel with greater understanding, and how to apply its teachings to our lives. 
	We’ll approach Luke’s gospel in three steps. First, we’ll consider the background of Luke’s gospel. Second, we’ll explore its structure and content. And third, we’ll look at some of its major themes. Let’s begin with the background of Luke’s gospel.
